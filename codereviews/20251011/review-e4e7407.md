# Code Review: e4e7407

## Summary
Adds GitHub repository selector UI for project creation (frontend implementation).

## Bad Smells Detected
None visible from commit title. This is the frontend component for the GitHub integration feature.

## Recommendations
Would need to review the actual UI code to check for:
- Testing implementation details (keyboard handlers, CSS classes, etc.)
- Testing specific UI text content
- Over-testing loading/error states
