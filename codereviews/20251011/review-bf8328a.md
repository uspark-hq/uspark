# Code Review: bf8328a

## Summary
Changes workspace from `/workspace` to `~/workspace` (home directory) to avoid permission issues in E2B sandbox. Supersedes the fix in commit 1ca2e99.

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is a proper fix for permission issues:
- Uses home directory which is guaranteed to be writable
- Simpler than root-level directory with permission management
- Follows Unix conventions
- No sudo or chown needed

## Recommendations
None. This is a better solution than the previous `/workspace` approach and properly fixes the EACCES permission errors.
