# Code Review: cbef66b

## Summary
Adds automatic cleanup of expired E2B sandbox CLI tokens to prevent database bloat. Cleanup is triggered before creating new sandbox tokens.

## Error Handling
**Good**: No try/catch blocks added. The cleanup operation will naturally fail if database issues occur, which is appropriate fail-fast behavior.

## Database Design
**Good approach**:
- Cleans up expired tokens before creating new ones
- Uses proper SQL conditions: `and(eq(userId), lt(expiresAt, new Date()))`
- Private method `cleanupExpiredTokens()` provides good encapsulation
- Cleanup is automatic and doesn't require manual intervention

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is good resource management:
- Fail-fast pattern (no defensive error handling)
- Proper database queries
- Automatic cleanup prevents accumulation
- Simple and maintainable

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding a scheduled cleanup job (cron) for additional safety, in case token creation fails before cleanup runs
2. Could add metrics/logging to track how many tokens are cleaned up (helps with monitoring)
3. Minor formatting fix is included in the diff (good)
