# Code Review: 1ca2e99

## Summary
Fixes E2B workspace directory permissions by setting up proper ownership in Dockerfile and executing commands in /workspace directory.

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is infrastructure fix:
- Proper Docker user setup (USER 1000)
- Fixes environment variable naming (CLAUDE_API_KEY â†’ CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN)
- Removes duplicate uspark pull logic
- Commands execute in correct working directory

## Recommendations
None. This is a proper Docker/permissions fix.

## Note
This commit was superseded by bf8328a which changed from `/workspace` to `~/workspace` for better reliability.
