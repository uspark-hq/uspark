# Code Review: adae6df

## Summary
Relaxes PROJECT_ID_FOR_DEV validation from `.uuid()` to `.min(1)` to support both UUID format and `proj_` prefixed IDs.

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is a simple validation fix to support the actual ID format used in the system (proj_ prefix).

**Good**: Maintains minimum validation while being more flexible.

## Recommendations
None. This is a straightforward bug fix.
