# Code Review: 33e1276

## Summary
Refactors E2E CLI authentication automation to use persistent stdout listeners, fixing a race condition where authentication success messages were missed due to timing issues.

## Error Handling
**Good**: Uses proper state management with flags (`authSuccess`, `authResolved`, `authResolve`) to coordinate between persistent listener and waiting code. No defensive try/catch added.

## Test Coverage
**Good improvements**:
- Persistent listeners attached immediately when spawning process
- Shared state variables prevent race conditions
- Polling for device code instead of relying on event timing
- Removes duplicate listener registration

**Architecture**:
- Listener set up once at process start
- State managed through closure variables
- Promise-based waiting pattern is clean

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is a proper fix for a real race condition:
- Uses event-driven architecture correctly
- No artificial delays added (polling interval is 100ms for device code, which is reasonable)
- State management is explicit and clear
- Fail-fast on timeout

## Recommendations
1. The 100ms polling interval for device code detection is reasonable but could be documented with a comment explaining why polling is needed
2. Consider extracting the persistent listener pattern into a reusable utility function if similar patterns appear elsewhere
