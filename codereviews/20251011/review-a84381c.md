# Code Review: a84381c

## Summary
Adds timeout and JSON validation to watch-claude stdout callback to prevent crashes from unexpected output or network issues in E2B sandbox environments.

## Error Handling
**Mixed quality**:

**Good**:
- 10-second timeout with AbortController is appropriate
- try/finally pattern ensures timeout cleanup
- JSON parsing try/catch silently skips non-JSON lines (reasonable for stdout parsing)

**Potential issue**:
- JSON parsing catch block has no error type narrowing and silently returns
- This is acceptable for stdout parsing but could hide actual errors

**Code structure**:
```typescript
try {
  event = JSON.parse(line);
} catch {
  // Skip non-JSON lines silently
  return;
}
```

The outer catch in `sendStdoutCallback` properly propagates errors up to be logged in stderr.

## Timer/Delay Analysis
**Good**: 10-second timeout is reasonable for HTTP requests. Uses AbortController which is the standard pattern for fetch timeouts. Not an artificial delay - it's a legitimate network timeout.

## Bad Smells Detected
None. This is proper error handling:
- Timeout is necessary for network reliability
- JSON validation prevents crashes from unexpected output
- Errors propagate naturally (caught at higher level and logged)
- No defensive try/catch pattern (the try/catch has specific purposes)

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding error type to the catch block for better debugging:
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  // Skip non-JSON lines silently (e.g., debug output, warnings)
  console.error(`[uspark] Skipped non-JSON line: ${line.substring(0, 100)}`);
  return;
}
```
But this is minor - silent skipping is acceptable for stdout parsing.
