### Commits with Notes (⚠️)

1. **b125693** - refactor(blocks): remove sequenceNumber and simplify block ordering
   - **Note**: Removed complex transaction logic with row-level locking
   - **Good**: Simplified from nested transactions to direct inserts
   - **Good**: Uses PostgreSQL's natural ordering via createdAt timestamps
   - **Good**: Tests properly updated to use API endpoints instead of direct DB
   - **Minor**: Migration combines two changes (drop claude_tokens + remove sequenceNumber)
   - **Overall**: Clean refactor that improves maintainability

2. **14a056c** - feat(web): add initial scan progress tracking with real-time updates
   - **Note**: Tests documented proper use of direct DB operations with justification
   - **Good**: Uses API endpoints (createSession, createTurn, onClaudeStdout)
   - **Good**: Direct DB ops limited to internal markers (session.type) with comments explaining why
   - **Good**: No any types, proper fail-fast error handling
   - **Good**: Extracted SCAN_POLL_INTERVAL_MS as constant
   - **Overall**: Excellent code quality with proper documentation

3. **3ed428f** - feat(web): streamline initial scan progress display
   - **Note**: Auto-redirect behavior could be jarring for users who want to review
   - **Good**: Simplified UI showing only in_progress tasks
   - **Good**: Comprehensive test coverage added (7 new tests)
   - **Minor**: Auto-redirect on both success and failure removes user control
   - **Overall**: Clean implementation, UX decision is acceptable for MVP

## Code Quality Analysis

### Strengths Observed

1. **No `any` Type Usage**: All commits maintained strict TypeScript typing (smell #9 ✅)
2. **No Lint Suppressions**: Zero eslint-disable or @ts-ignore comments (smell #14 ✅)
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Fail-fast approach, no defensive try/catch blocks (smell #3 ✅)
4. **Test Quality**: Tests use API endpoints instead of direct DB operations where appropriate (smell #12 ✅)
5. **No Fake Timers**: Real async behavior in tests, no vi.useFakeTimers() (smell #5, #10 ✅)
6. **No Artificial Delays**: No setTimeout or Promise delays in tests (smell #10 ✅)

### Areas of Excellence

1. **commit d69197b**: Exemplary polling implementation with proper signal handling and test environment detection
2. **commit b125693**: Bold refactor removing complex transaction logic for simpler, more maintainable code
3. **commit 14a056c**: Thorough documentation of edge cases and proper justification for exceptional DB usage
4. **commit 2aef5c3**: Real E2E testing without mocking demonstrates commitment to integration testing

### Minor Observations

1. **commit b125693**: Migration file combines two separate concerns (could have been split)
2. **commit 3ed428f**: Auto-redirect removes user agency but acceptable for MVP
3. Several commits used as "release triggers" (e.g., documentation changes to trigger deployments)

## Recommendations

### For Future Commits

1. **Continue Current Standards**: The codebase demonstrates excellent adherence to the bad-smell specification
2. **Migration Granularity**: Consider splitting migrations that address multiple unrelated concerns
3. **UX Testing**: For auto-redirect features, consider adding user feedback or progress indicators
4. **Release Triggering**: Consider using empty commits with fix: prefix rather than documentation changes for release triggers

### Testing Practices

1. **Maintain Real Integration Tests**: Continue the excellent practice of real E2E tests over mocked ones
2. **API-First Testing**: Keep using API endpoints in tests rather than direct database operations
3. **Test Documentation**: Excellent use of comments justifying exceptional DB usage in tests

## Conclusion

This batch of commits demonstrates **excellent code quality** and strong adherence to project standards. The team is:

- ✅ Maintaining strict type safety
- ✅ Avoiding common anti-patterns
- ✅ Writing meaningful tests
- ✅ Following fail-fast error handling
- ✅ Properly documenting code

**Overall Assessment**: **APPROVED** - All 21 commits are suitable for production deployment.
