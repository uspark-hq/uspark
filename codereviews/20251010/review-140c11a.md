- **Message**: chore: filter .DS_Store files in cli push command (#456)
- **Author**: Ethan Zhang
- **Date**: Fri Oct 10 11:45:33 2025 +0800

## Summary
Filter `.DS_Store` macOS system files from being pushed to server, with proper .gitignore entry and test coverage.

## Changes
- Added `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`
- Added filtering logic in `getAllFiles()` to skip `.DS_Store` files
- Added test coverage to verify filtering works

## Code Quality Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Proper Test Coverage** - Added tests to verify the filtering works
   - Tests check both root and subdirectory `.DS_Store` files
   - Verifies files are not uploaded
   - Good test coverage for a simple feature

2. **Simple Implementation** - Clean, focused change
   - Single `if` statement to skip the file
   - No over-engineering

3. **No Error Handling** - Simple continue statement
   - No defensive try/catch
   - Follows fail-fast principle

4. **Gitignore Addition** - Proper prevention of tracking these files
   - Prevents `.DS_Store` from being committed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Observations

1. **Hardcoded Filename** - `.DS_Store` is hardcoded as a string literal
   - For this use case, this is acceptable
   - Alternative would be a constants file, but that would be over-engineering
   - Follows YAGNI principle - don't create abstractions until needed

2. **Simple String Comparison** - Uses `entry.name === ".DS_Store"`
   - Could use a more flexible pattern matching approach
   - However, for a single file name, this is the simplest solution
   - Follows YAGNI - no need for regex or patterns yet

3. **Placement in Code** - Filter added after directory check
   - Correct placement - only checks files, not directories
   - Good logic flow

### üìä Code Smell Checklist

- ‚úÖ Mock Analysis: No new mocks
- ‚úÖ Test Coverage: Proper tests added
- ‚úÖ Error Handling: No defensive programming
- ‚úÖ Interface Changes: No interface changes
- ‚úÖ Timer/Delay: No timers
- ‚úÖ Dynamic Imports: No dynamic imports
- ‚úÖ Type Safety: No type issues
- ‚úÖ Lint Suppressions: No suppressions
- ‚úÖ YAGNI: Simple solution, no over-engineering

## Verdict

**APPROVED** ‚úÖ

This is a clean, simple fix that follows all project principles:
- Simple implementation without over-engineering
- Proper test coverage
- No defensive programming
- Follows YAGNI (doesn't create abstractions for a single file filter)

The hardcoded string is appropriate for this use case. If more system files need filtering in the future, that would be the time to refactor to a list or pattern-based approach.
