- **Message**: feat(workspace): handle github repository 404 as normal state (#461)
- **Author**: Ethan Zhang
- **Date**: Fri Oct 10 12:54:07 2025 -0700

## Summary
Treats GitHub repository 404 responses as normal state (repository doesn't exist) rather than errors, enabling better UX for repository creation flow.

## Changes
- Modified `githubRepository` signal to catch 404 errors and return `{ repository: null }`
- Added explicit return type with nullable `GitHubRepository`
- Re-throws non-404 errors for proper error handling
- Added `throwIfAbort` utility function for abort signal handling

## Code Quality Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Proper Error Handling** - Uses try/catch for a specific, meaningful purpose
   - NOT defensive programming - it's converting 404 to a valid state
   - Only catches 404, re-throws all other errors
   - This is appropriate error handling, not defensive coding

2. **Type Safety** - Adds explicit nullable return type
   - `Promise<{ repository: GitHubRepository | null }>`
   - Makes it clear that repository can be null
   - Improves type safety for consumers

3. **Abort Signal Handling** - Added `throwIfAbort` utility
   - Properly re-throws abort errors in catch block
   - Follows ESLint rule `custom/no-catch-abort`
   - Good practice for handling cancellation

4. **No Fallback Pattern** - Re-throws non-404 errors
   - Follows principle #13 (Avoid Fallback Patterns - Fail Fast)
   - Only 404 is treated as normal state, everything else fails

5. **Explicit Type Imports** - Uses `type` keyword for type-only import
   - `type GitHubRepository` import
   - Good TypeScript practice

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Observations

1. **Error Handling Rationale** - This is NOT defensive programming
   - 404 is a valid state in REST semantics ("resource not found")
   - Converting 404 to null is semantic mapping, not error suppression
   - All other errors propagate properly

2. **API Design** - Good separation of concerns
   - API layer keeps RESTful semantics (404 = not found)
   - Signal layer converts to domain concept (null = doesn't exist)
   - UI can differentiate between "create needed" vs "error occurred"

3. **Utility Function** - `throwIfAbort` is simple and focused
   - Complements existing `throwIfNotAbort` function
   - Good symmetry in the API

### üìä Code Smell Checklist

- ‚úÖ Mock Analysis: No mocks added
- ‚úÖ Test Coverage: No test changes shown (existing tests should cover this)
- ‚úÖ Error Handling: Appropriate, not defensive (specific purpose, re-throws others)
- ‚úÖ Interface Changes: Return type made explicitly nullable (good!)
- ‚úÖ Timer/Delay: No timers
- ‚úÖ Dynamic Imports: No dynamic imports
- ‚úÖ Type Safety: Improved with explicit nullable type
- ‚úÖ Lint Suppressions: No suppressions
- ‚úÖ Fail Fast: Non-404 errors are re-thrown (good!)

## Verdict

**APPROVED** ‚úÖ

This is excellent error handling that follows all project principles:

1. **Not Defensive Programming** - The try/catch has a specific, meaningful purpose: converting 404 (a valid REST response) into domain semantics (null)
2. **Fail Fast** - All errors except 404 are re-thrown
3. **Type Safety** - Explicit nullable return type
4. **Proper Abort Handling** - Uses utility function to re-throw abort errors

This is a good example of when try/catch is appropriate:
- Specific error type handling (404 only)
- Semantic conversion (HTTP status ‚Üí domain concept)
- All other errors propagate
- Better UX (create button instead of error message)

The commit properly distinguishes between "resource doesn't exist" (normal state) and actual errors (network, auth, etc.).
