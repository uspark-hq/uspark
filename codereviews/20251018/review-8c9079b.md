## Code Quality Analysis

### ✅ Clean Code - No Issues Found

This commit contains only CSS/styling changes focused on UI alignment and spacing improvements. The changes are straightforward and do not introduce any of the bad code smells outlined in our quality standards.

### What Was Changed

1. **CSS Styling (index.css)**
   - Added `.cm-editor` height: 100% rule
   - Added `.cm-content` padding: 1rem with !important flag
   - Comment in Chinese: "CodeMirror 编辑器样式优化"

2. **Component Header Alignment (3 files)**
   - chat-window.tsx: Changed from `py-1.5` to `h-8` with flexbox
   - file-tree.tsx: Changed from `py-1.5` to `h-8` with flexbox
   - markdown-editor.tsx: Changed from `py-1.5` to `h-8` with flexbox

3. **Dependency Lock File**
   - pnpm-lock.yaml: Auto-generated dependency resolution updates

### Minor Observations

1. **Chinese Comment** (index.css:14)
   - Comment "CodeMirror 编辑器样式优化" is in Chinese
   - While not a code smell, consider using English for consistency
   - Not a blocker, just a style preference

2. **!important Usage** (index.css:20)
   - Uses `!important` flag for padding override
   - This is acceptable for third-party library customization (CodeMirror)
   - Sometimes necessary to override library defaults
