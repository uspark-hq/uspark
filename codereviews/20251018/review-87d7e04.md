## Bad Code Smell Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ **PASS** - No mocks introduced in this commit.

### 2. Test Coverage
✅ **PASS** - Commit mentions all tests pass (177 tests). However, there appears to be no test specifically verifying the editable behavior change.

**Observation:** While tests pass, there's no explicit test coverage for the new editing functionality. Consider adding tests that verify users can actually edit markdown content.

### 3. Error Handling
✅ **PASS** - No error handling changes in this commit.

### 4. Interface Changes
✅ **PASS** - Changes internal editor configuration only. The public interface remains unchanged. This is a behavioral change (read-only → editable) but not a breaking API change.

**Note:** The commit message mentions "Save functionality may need to be implemented separately to persist edits" - this suggests the feature may be incomplete.

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ **PASS** - No timers, delays, or fake timers introduced.

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
✅ **PASS** - No dynamic imports in this commit.

### 7. Database and Service Mocking in Web Tests
✅ **PASS** - Not applicable to this commit.

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ **PASS** - No test changes, so no mock cleanup needed.

### 9. TypeScript `any` Type Usage
✅ **PASS** - No `any` types introduced.

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ **PASS** - No test delays introduced.

### 11. Hardcoded URLs and Configuration
✅ **PASS** - No hardcoded URLs or configuration values.

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ **PASS** - Not applicable to this commit.

### 13. Avoid Fallback Patterns - Fail Fast
✅ **PASS** - No fallback patterns introduced.

### 14. Prohibition of Lint/Type Suppressions
✅ **PASS** - No lint or type suppression comments added.

### 15. Avoid Bad Tests
✅ **PASS** - No new tests added (though this itself may be a concern - see Test Coverage above).

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED with recommendations

This is a minimal, focused change that enables editing mode. The code change is clean and straightforward.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add integration tests** - Test that users can actually edit markdown content in the editor
2. **Complete the feature** - The commit notes mention "Save functionality may need to be implemented separately" - ensure a follow-up commit implements save/persist functionality
3. **Consider feature flag** - For such a behavioral change, consider using a feature flag to enable/disable editing mode

**Positive aspects:**
- Small, focused commit
- Clear commit message
- Comment updated from Chinese to indicate the mode change
- All existing tests pass
