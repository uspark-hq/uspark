**Commit:** feat: improve claude chat ui with collapsible tool results (#590)

## Summary
This commit improves the Claude chat UI by adding collapsible tool results that automatically collapse when exceeding 3 lines. It includes UI improvements (removing emoji from avatars), code refactoring (extracting helper functions), and comprehensive test coverage.

## Code Quality Analysis

### Issues Found

#### 1. Test Implementation Detail Testing (Category 15 - Avoid Bad Tests)
**Location:** `block-display.test.tsx`

**Issue:** Tests are checking implementation details like CSS selectors and DOM structure:
```typescript
const clickableHeader = container.querySelector('[style*="cursor: pointer"]');
```

**Problem:** This test relies on inline styles which are implementation details. If the component is refactored to use CSS classes or a different styling approach, the test will break even though the functionality remains correct.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Recommendation:** Test user-visible behavior instead. Use semantic queries or test IDs:
```typescript
// Better approach
const header = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /tool result/i });
await user.click(header);
```

#### 2. Magic Number - Line Count Threshold (Minor Code Smell)
**Location:** `block-display.tsx`

**Issue:** The collapse threshold (3 lines) is hardcoded in multiple places:
```typescript
function shouldCollapseText(text: string): boolean {
  return text.split("\n").length > 3;
}

const previewText = shouldCollapse
  ? resultText.split("\n").slice(0, 3).join("\n") + "..."
  : resultText;
```

**Severity:** LOW

**Recommendation:** Extract to a named constant for maintainability:
```typescript
const COLLAPSE_LINE_THRESHOLD = 3;
```

### Positive Observations

1. **Good Refactoring:** Extracted helper functions `getToolResultText()` and `shouldCollapseText()` to reduce code duplication
2. **Proper Test Coverage:** Added comprehensive tests covering all collapse scenarios (8 test cases)
3. **No Mocks Introduced:** Tests don't rely on mocking, testing real component behavior
4. **Clean UI Improvement:** Removed emoji for professional appearance
5. **Smart Default State:** Components start in the most useful state (collapsed for long content)
6. **User-Focused Feature:** Addresses real UX problem of overwhelming tool output
7. **No TypeScript any:** All code properly typed
8. **No Lint Suppressions:** No suppression comments added

## Verdict
**âœ… APPROVED WITH SUGGESTIONS** - This is a solid feature improvement with good test coverage. The only concern is the test implementation detail checking (CSS selector queries), which is a minor issue that doesn't block approval. The feature itself is well-designed and properly implemented.

**Suggestions for Future Improvement:**
1. Replace `container.querySelector('[style*="cursor: pointer"]')` with semantic queries or test IDs
2. Extract the collapse threshold (3 lines) to a named constant
3. Consider using data-testid for interactive elements to make tests more robust
