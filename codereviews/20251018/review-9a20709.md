**Commit:** fix: improve repository selector UX and test quality (#585)

## Summary
This commit redesigns the GitHubRepoSelector as a combobox with popover, migrates tests from `global.fetch` mocking to MSW, and reduces test count from 9 to 5 by removing over-tested scenarios. It also documents MSW unhandled requests issue in tech-debt.md.

## Code Quality Analysis

### Issues Found

#### 1. MSW Unhandled Request Warning (Category 1 - Mock Analysis)
**Location:** `github-repo-selector.test.tsx`

**Issue:** MSW handler doesn't match actual request URL, causing unhandled requests:
```typescript
http.get("http://localhost:3000/api/github/repositories", () => {
  return HttpResponse.json({ repositories: mockRepositories });
}),
```

**Problem:** The handler uses hardcoded localhost URL instead of wildcard pattern, likely causing the unhandled request warnings mentioned in the commit.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Recommendation:** Use wildcard pattern as suggested in the tech-debt documentation:
```typescript
http.get("*/api/github/repositories", () => {
  return HttpResponse.json({ repositories: mockRepositories });
}),
```

#### 2. Bypass Mode Silencing Real Issues (Category 1 - Mock Analysis)
**Location:** `github-repo-selector.test.tsx`

**Issue:** Using `onUnhandledRequest: "bypass"` to silence warnings:
```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: "bypass" });
});
```

**Problem:** This hides the real problem instead of fixing it. The bypass mode silences the warning about unhandled requests, making it unclear if mocks are actually working.

**Severity:** HIGH

**Recommendation:** Use `"error"` mode and fix the handler pattern:
```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: "error" });
});
```

#### 3. Test Implementation Detail Testing (Category 15 - Avoid Bad Tests)
**Location:** Tests still checking some implementation details

**Issue:** While the tests are much improved, there are still some areas testing implementation:
```typescript
// Verify search input is visible (popover is open)
expect(screen.getByPlaceholderText("Search repositories...")).toBeInTheDocument();
```

**Severity:** LOW

**Note:** This is actually acceptable because the placeholder text is a UI detail that users see. Not a major concern.

### Positive Observations

1. **Excellent Test Cleanup:** Removed 4 over-tested scenarios (loading states, error responses, empty states) that provided no value - this aligns perfectly with bad-smell.md #15
2. **MSW Migration:** Properly migrated from `global.fetch` mocking to MSW as required by bad-smell.md #1
3. **Focus on User Behavior:** Tests now verify what users can actually do (select, view, close popover)
4. **Better UX:** Combobox design is cleaner and more intuitive than previous implementation
5. **Proper Cleanup:** Added `vi.clearAllMocks()` in beforeEach
6. **No TypeScript any:** All code properly typed
7. **No Lint Suppressions:** No suppression comments
8. **Tech Debt Documentation:** Properly documented the MSW issue in tech-debt.md
9. **Semantic Queries:** Tests use `getByRole` which is best practice
10. **User-Centric Testing:** Tests verify user-visible behavior like "should close popover after selecting"

### Critical Improvement Over Previous Version

The test improvements are **exemplary**:

**Removed over-tested cases (aligned with bad-smell.md #15):**
- ❌ "displays loading state initially" - trivial conditional rendering
- ❌ "displays error message on fetch failure" - just HTTP status testing
- ❌ "displays 401 error message when unauthorized" - over-testing error responses
- ❌ "displays empty state when no repositories found" - trivial rendering

**Added meaningful tests:**
- ✅ "should allow user to select a repository from the list" - actual user workflow
- ✅ "should display selected repository information after selection" - user-visible behavior
- ✅ "should show privacy badge for selected repository" - important feature verification
- ✅ "should group repositories by owner" - organizational feature
- ✅ "should close popover after selecting a repository" - UX behavior

This is **exactly** what bad-smell.md advocates for.

## Review Checklist

- [x] No new mocks introduced (migrated to better mock approach)
- [x] Excellent test coverage improvement
- [x] No error handling anti-patterns
- [x] No interface breaking changes
- [x] No fake timers or artificial delays
- [x] No dynamic imports that should be static
- [x] No database/service mocking in web tests
- [x] Test mock cleanup properly implemented
- [x] No TypeScript `any` types
- [x] No artificial delays in tests
- [x] No hardcoded URLs in production code
- [x] No direct database operations in tests
- [x] No fallback patterns
- [x] No lint/type suppressions
- [~] MSW handler needs fixing (bypass mode + wrong URL pattern)

## Verdict
**✅ APPROVED WITH REQUIRED FIX** - This is an excellent refactoring that demonstrates deep understanding of testing best practices from bad-smell.md. The test quality improvements are exactly what the spec requires.

**However, there is one critical issue that must be fixed:**

The MSW configuration is using bypass mode and hardcoded localhost URL instead of fixing the actual handler pattern. This needs to be corrected:

```typescript
// Current (problematic):
const server = setupServer(
  http.get("http://localhost:3000/api/github/repositories", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ repositories: mockRepositories });
  }),
);

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: "bypass" }); // Hides the problem
});

// Fixed version:
const server = setupServer(
  http.get("*/api/github/repositories", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ repositories: mockRepositories });
  }),
);

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: "error" }); // Surfaces problems
});
```

**This fix should be applied immediately** to ensure tests are actually using mocks correctly and to catch any future handler mismatches.
