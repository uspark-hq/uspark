## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Commit 18c5fdd - Repository Selector (MUST FIX)
**File:** `review-18c5fdd.md`

**Issues:**
1. ‚ùå **Fetch Mocking Instead of MSW** (Bad Smell #1)
   - Using `global.fetch = vi.fn()` instead of MSW
   - Action: Replace with MSW handlers

   - Contains `// eslint-disable-next-line` comment
   - Action: Fix the underlying issue, remove suppression

3. ‚ùå **TypeScript `any` Type** (Bad Smell #9 - Zero Tolerance)
   - Using `as any` type cast
   - Action: Define proper types

**Status:** BLOCKED - Must be fixed before merge

### 2. Commit 9a20709 - Repository Selector UX (MUST FIX)
**File:** `review-9a20709.md`

**Issues:**
1. ‚ùå **MSW Handler with Hardcoded URL**
   - Using `http://localhost:3000/` instead of wildcard `*/`
   - Using `onUnhandledRequest: "bypass"` to hide warnings
   - Action: Fix MSW pattern and use `onUnhandledRequest: "error"`

**Status:** BLOCKED - Critical MSW misconfiguration
