## Summary

Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in API contracts and improved turn UI with animated loading indicator.

## Code Quality Analysis

### ✅ Clean Code - No Issues Found

This commit contains clean refactoring of API contracts and UI improvements without introducing code quality issues.

### What Was Changed

1. **API Contract Cleanup (3 files)**
   - Removed unnecessary `headers` validation from ts-rest contracts
   - Rationale: Authentication is handled by Clerk middleware, so header validation in contracts is redundant
   - Files: cli-auth.contract.ts, projects.contract.ts, share.contract.ts

2. **UI Improvement (turn-display.tsx)**
   - Removed 40-line `TurnStatusBadge` component
   - Added simple animated ellipsis indicator for in-progress turns
   - Net change: 11 additions, 55 deletions (cleaner code!)

### Positive Observations

1. **Code Simplification**
   - Removed complex status badge component with 5 different status configurations
   - Replaced with minimal animated indicator (3 dots with staggered pulse)
   - Follows "simpler is better" principle

2. **Proper TypeScript Fixes**
   - Fixed genuine TypeScript errors instead of using suppressions
   - Removed invalid Zod header schemas that didn't satisfy index signatures
   - No use of `@ts-ignore` or other suppressions ✅

3. **Clean Animation**
   - Uses Tailwind's built-in `animate-pulse` utility
   - Staggered delays with `[animation-delay:Xms]` syntax
   - No custom timers or fake timers in production code

## Review Checklist

- [x] No new mocks introduced
- [x] No test coverage issues (no test changes)
- [x] No error handling anti-patterns
- [x] No interface changes (removed redundant validation)
- [x] No timers or delays (CSS animations only)
- [x] No dynamic imports
- [x] No database/service mocking
- [x] No artificial test delays
- [x] No hardcoded URLs/config
- [x] No TypeScript `any` types (except existing `z.any()` for binary data)
- [x] No lint suppressions
- [x] No fallback patterns

## Verdict

**✅ APPROVED** - Excellent refactoring that simplifies code and fixes TypeScript errors properly.

## Key Strengths

1. **Code Reduction**: Removed 44 lines, added 11 (net -33 lines)
2. **Better UX**: Simple animated indicator is less visually noisy than status badges
3. **Proper Type Fixes**: Fixed TypeScript errors by removing incorrect validation, not by suppression
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication handled by middleware, not contract validation
