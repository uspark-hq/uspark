- **Author**: Ethan Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-10-02 10:21:07 +0000

## Summary
Removed 2 duplicate error tests from contract-fetch utility. Kept one representative test to verify error handling works.

## Bad Smell Analysis

### Category 15: Bad Tests - Over-testing Error Responses
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT - REMOVED BAD SMELL
- Deleted "should throw ContractFetchError for 400 response" test
- Deleted "should handle non-JSON error responses" test
- Kept "should throw ContractFetchError for 404 response" as representative test
- **Rationale clearly stated**: "Testing every possible error status code (400, 404, 500) is over-testing"
- Perfect example of strategic test reduction

### All Other Categories
**Status**: ✅ CLEAN - No issues in other categories

## Overall Assessment
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT

Smart test consolidation:
- Removed 2 duplicate error tests
- Kept 1 representative test
- Commit message explains reasoning clearly
- Part of Phase 2 Batch 14

## Notes
- Shows good judgment: keep ONE test to verify mechanism
- Don't test every status code variation
- This pattern should be applied project-wide
