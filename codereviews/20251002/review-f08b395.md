## Summary
Major refactoring that simplified session polling from complex state-based tracking (turn1:3,turn2:5) to simple lastBlockId approach. Improved tests significantly.

## Bad Smell Analysis

### Category 2: Test Coverage
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ POSITIVE IMPROVEMENT
- Test file grew from smaller to 169 lines with better coverage
- Added comprehensive test scenarios

### Category 3: Error Handling
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT - SIMPLIFIED
- Removed complex state parsing error handling
- Simpler timestamp-based logic reduces error surface
- Follows fail-fast principle

### Category 4: Interface Changes
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ POSITIVE - BREAKING BUT BETTER
- **Simplified API**: `state: string` → `lastBlockId?: string`
- Breaking change but significantly simpler
- Better developer experience

### Category 13: Fallback Patterns
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT - REMOVED COMPLEXITY
- Removed complex state map parsing fallbacks
- Simpler, more direct approach
- Less code paths = easier maintenance

### All Other Categories
**Status**: ✅ CLEAN - No issues in other categories

## Overall Assessment
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ OUTSTANDING

This is exemplary refactoring work that:
- Simplified complex state-based tracking
- Improved test coverage and quality
- Reduced code complexity significantly
- Better performance (timestamp comparison vs parsing)
- More maintainable architecture
- Proper breaking change with clear migration path

## Recommendations
None. This is a model refactoring commit.

## Notes
- Part of October 2nd refactoring effort
- Shows how simplification improves both code and tests
- Test expansion here is GOOD (better coverage of simpler code)
- Aligns with YAGNI and simplicity principles
