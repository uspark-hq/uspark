## Bad Smell Analysis

### Category 15: Bad Tests - Testing Loading/Error States Without Logic
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT - REMOVED MAJOR BAD SMELL
- Deleted loading state tests from page components
- Deleted error state tests from page components
- These tests just check conditional rendering, not business logic
- Directly implements bad-smell.md category 15 guidelines
- 151 lines of trivial tests removed

### All Other Categories: ✅ CLEAN

## Overall Assessment
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ OUTSTANDING

Major cleanup of trivial state rendering tests:
- Loading state tests: just checking if spinner appears
- Error state tests: just checking if error message displays
- No business logic tested
- 151 lines removed
- Part of Phase 2 Batch 10

## Notes
- Classic example from bad-smell.md implemented
- Tests were checking `isLoading={true}` → spinner appears
- These tests provide zero confidence
