## Summary
Improved TypeScript type inference in contractFetch and simplified contracts by removing redundant error response definitions. Net -45 lines.

## Bad Smell Analysis

### Category 3: Error Handling
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT - SIMPLIFIED ERROR HANDLING
- **Removed all error response type definitions** (401, 404, 400, 500)
- Contracts now only define success responses
- Simplified API routes with inline error objects
- Reduced project-detail.contract.ts by 22% (316→247 lines)
- Follows fail-fast and simplicity principles

### Category 9: TypeScript `any` Usage
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ POSITIVE - REMOVED `any`
- Added proper handling for `z.any()` types → `ArrayBuffer`
- Improved type inference eliminates need for `any`
- Better type safety throughout

### Category 15: Bad Tests
**Status**: ⭐⭐⭐ POSITIVE IMPACT
- Simplified contracts make tests more focused
- Removed error response testing boilerplate need
- Supports the error over-testing cleanup effort

### All Other Categories
**Status**: ✅ CLEAN - No issues

## Overall Assessment
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ OUTSTANDING

Exceptional refactoring that:
- Improved type inference across codebase
- Removed redundant error type definitions
- Simplified 14 files, -45 lines net
- Better TypeScript safety (ArrayBuffer vs any)
- Supports test cleanup effort (less error testing needed)
- All checks passing (lint, types, tests, knip)

## Recommendations
None. This is exemplary type system improvement work.

## Notes
- Directly supports the test cleanup effort
- Fewer error types = less temptation to over-test them
- Type inference improvements reduce boilerplate
- Aligns perfectly with simplification goals
