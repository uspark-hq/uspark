# Code Review: a90910b - refactor: extract code review criteria to bad-smell.md

## Commit Summary
Organizational refactoring that extracts code review criteria from command documentation to a centralized specification file. Creates the foundation for the bad-smell.md specification and updates references accordingly.

## Changes Analysis
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/commands/code-review.md` (33 deletions, 15 additions)
  - `spec/bad-smell.md` (36 additions)
- **Type**: Documentation refactoring and centralization
- **Purpose**: Improve maintainability and reusability of code quality standards

## Compliance Assessment

### ✅ Fully Compliant Areas
- **Documentation Structure**: Clear separation of concerns between command docs and specifications
- **Mock Analysis**: Adds specific guideline about fetch API mocking (should use MSW instead)
- **Interface Changes**: No breaking changes, only documentation reorganization

### ✅ Good Practices Demonstrated
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminates duplication between command docs and specifications
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralizes bad code smell definitions
- **Maintainability**: Makes criteria reusable across different tools and documentation
- **Clear References**: Updates code-review.md to reference centralized location

### ✅ Quality Improvements
- **Enhanced Mock Guidelines**: Specifically mentions MSW for network mocking
- **Structured Organization**: Creates dedicated specification directory structure
- **Reusability**: Enables other tools to reference same quality standards

### Content Quality
The extracted criteria maintain all original standards:
- Mock analysis with alternatives
- Test coverage evaluation
- Error handling patterns
- Interface change documentation
- Timer and delay analysis
- Dynamic import patterns

## Technical Assessment

### Documentation Architecture
```
Before: Criteria embedded in command docs
After:  Centralized spec with clear references
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Maintainability**: Single location for quality criteria updates
2. **Consistency**: Same standards across all tools and processes
3. **Discoverability**: Dedicated specification directory
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new bad smell categories

## Overall Assessment
**EXCELLENT** - This is a thoughtful refactoring that improves documentation architecture without changing functionality. The reorganization creates a scalable foundation for code quality standards and demonstrates good information architecture principles.

## Key Strengths
1. **Clean separation**: Command documentation vs. specification standards
2. **No functionality loss**: All original criteria preserved
3. **Enhanced guidelines**: Adds specific MSW recommendation for fetch mocking
4. **Future-proof structure**: Creates extensible specification framework
