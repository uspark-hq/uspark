**Commit Message:** feat(workspace): add real-time session polling mechanism (#512)

**Author:** Ethan Zhang

**Date:** Tue Oct 14 21:44:55 2025 -0700

## Summary

This commit implements a real-time session polling mechanism to keep the workspace UI synchronized with server-side changes. The implementation uses smart polling intervals (1s when active, 5s when idle) and includes comprehensive test coverage. A new dependency `signal-timers` was added to enable interruptible delays that respect AbortSignal.

## Files Changed

- turbo/apps/workspace/package.json (+1 dependency)
- turbo/apps/workspace/src/signals/project/__tests__/watch-session.test.ts (+254 lines, new file)
- turbo/apps/workspace/src/signals/project/project-page.ts (+8 lines)
- turbo/apps/workspace/src/signals/project/project.ts (+82 lines)
- turbo/apps/workspace/src/signals/utils.ts (+1 line)
- turbo/pnpm-lock.yaml (updated)

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ No issues found - Tests use MSW for HTTP mocking which is appropriate.

### 2. Test Coverage
✅ Excellent - 254 lines of comprehensive tests covering:
- Edge cases (no session, no turns)
- Different turn statuses
- Change detection logic
- Polling behavior

### 3. Error Handling
✅ No issues found - Errors are handled gracefully with exponential backoff, and the polling loop continues.

### 4. Interface Changes
✅ No issues found - New computed signals and command added, no breaking changes.

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ Good approach - Uses `signal-timers` library for interruptible delays instead of `setTimeout`. The delays respect AbortSignal for proper cancellation. The `IN_VITEST` check ensures tests execute only one loop iteration, avoiding test timeouts.

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 7. Database Mocking in Tests
✅ No issues found - Tests use API mocking, not database mocking.

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ Good - Uses `afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())` to clean up MSW handlers between tests.

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
✅ No issues found

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ Excellent - The `IN_VITEST` flag prevents delays from executing in tests. The polling loop executes exactly once in test environment, making tests deterministic and fast.

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues found

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ No issues found - Tests use helper functions and API mocking.

### 13. Fallback Patterns
✅ No issues found

### 14. Lint/Type Suppressions
✅ No issues found

### 15. Bad Test Patterns
✅ Good - Tests verify actual behavior (polling logic, change detection) rather than testing implementation details.

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Key Issues:** None

**Recommendations:**
- The use of `signal-timers` for interruptible delays is a good architectural choice
- The `IN_VITEST` flag to control test execution is pragmatic and prevents flaky tests
- Test coverage is thorough and well-structured
