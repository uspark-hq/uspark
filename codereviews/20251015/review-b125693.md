**Author:** Ethan Zhang

**Date:** Tue Oct 14 23:08:19 2025 -0700

## Summary

This commit removes the sequenceNumber field from blocks and uses createdAt timestamps for ordering instead. This significantly simplifies the code by eliminating complex transactions with row-level locking that were causing connection pool exhaustion and deadlocks.

## Files Changed

- 22 files changed
- +817 insertions, -165 deletions
- Removed sequenceNumber field from schema
- Removed complex transaction logic (~50 lines)
- Updated all tests to remove sequenceNumber references

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 2. Test Coverage
✅ Good - All existing tests updated to reflect the new ordering mechanism.

### 3. Error Handling
✅ Excellent improvement - Removed complex transaction code that was prone to errors. The new approach is simpler and more reliable.

### 4. Interface Changes
⚠️ **Breaking Change**: API responses no longer include sequence_number field. Blocks now ordered by createdAt instead. This is documented and intentional.

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 7. Database Mocking in Tests
✅ No issues found

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ No issues found

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
✅ No issues found

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ No issues found

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues found

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ No issues found

### 13. Fallback Patterns
✅ No issues found

### 14. Lint/Type Suppressions
✅ No issues found

### 15. Bad Test Patterns
✅ No issues found

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Key Issues:** None (breaking change is intentional and documented)

**Recommendations:**
- This is an excellent simplification that follows YAGNI principles
- Removing complex transaction logic reduces code complexity and eliminates deadlock issues
- Using PostgreSQL's DEFAULT now() for ordering is more reliable than manual sequence numbers
- The migration path is clear with the included SQL migration
