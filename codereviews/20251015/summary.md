## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Excellent Practices Observed

#### 1. YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Multiple commits demonstrate aggressive simplification:
- **cdb45a6:** Removed entire token management system (-1,142 lines)
- **b125693:** Removed unnecessary sequenceNumber field
- **7560def:** Removed unnecessary polling mechanism
- **3326b37:** Simplified project list by removing status display

#### 2. Fail-Fast Error Handling
No defensive programming patterns found:

- Errors propagate naturally
- Clean error boundaries where needed

#### 3. Zero Tolerance Standards
Perfect adherence to:
- No `any` types in TypeScript
- No lint/type suppressions
- No artificial delays in tests
- No fake timers

#### 4. Testing Best Practices
- MSW for network mocking
- Real database in integration tests
- No mocking of implementation details
- Comprehensive E2E coverage
