**Date:** Tue Oct 14 21:20:34 2025 -0700

## Summary

This commit removes individual user Claude token management and replaces it with a shared DEFAULT_CLAUDE_TOKEN from environment variables. This significantly simplifies the onboarding flow by eliminating the token configuration step. The change includes removing the claude_tokens table, related API endpoints, UI pages, and encryption logic.

**Breaking Change Documented**: This commit intentionally introduces a breaking change by removing individual token configuration. The PR description clearly documents this as an intentional trade-off for MVP simplification.

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 7. Database Mocking in Tests
✅ No issues found - Tests correctly removed direct database operations for Claude tokens.

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ No issues found

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
✅ No issues found

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ No issues found

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues found

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ Good - The commit actually removes direct database operations that were previously in tests. This is an improvement.

✅ No issues found

### 15. Bad Test Patterns
✅ No issues found - Test changes appropriately simplify test cases by removing obsolete token-related tests.

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Key Issues:** None

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure DEFAULT_CLAUDE_TOKEN is properly configured in all deployment environments (GitHub Actions, Vercel preview/production)
- Run database migration to drop claude_tokens table after deployment
- The simplification aligns well with YAGNI principles by removing unnecessary complexity for the MVP phase
