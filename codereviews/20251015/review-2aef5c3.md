**Author:** Ethan Zhang

**Date:** Wed Oct 15 11:25:21 2025 -0700

## Summary

This commit adds a complete end-to-end test for the manual project creation workflow without mocking or request interception. It tests the real flow from sign-in through project creation to workspace redirect. The commit also fixes the CI pipeline to deploy preview when e2e tests change.

## Files Changed

- .github/workflows/turbo.yml (+20 lines, -2 lines)
- e2e/web/tests/new-project-multi-step-flow.spec.ts (+46 lines, -34 lines)
- Total: +46 insertions, -34 deletions

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ Excellent - Explicitly avoids mocking to test the complete real flow. This is the correct approach for E2E tests.

### 2. Test Coverage
✅ Good - Tests complete user journey from sign-in to workspace redirect.

### 3. Error Handling
✅ No issues found

### 4. Interface Changes
✅ No issues found

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ Good - Removed unnecessary custom timeout and uses default 30s from config (as noted in commit message).

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
✅ No issues found

### 7. Database Mocking in Tests
✅ Excellent - E2E test creates real data in the database, which is correct for end-to-end testing.

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ No issues found

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
✅ No issues found

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ Excellent - No artificial delays, waits for actual UI elements and navigation.

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues found

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ Excellent - E2E test uses real API endpoints and database operations, not mocks.

### 13. Fallback Patterns
✅ No issues found

### 14. Lint/Type Suppressions
✅ No issues found

### 15. Bad Test Patterns
✅ Excellent - This test demonstrates best practices for E2E testing:
- No mocking or request interception
- Tests complete real flow
- Creates actual test data
- Verifies real navigation and page loads
- Uses unique project names with timestamps
- PR description explicitly explains "Why No Mocking?"

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Key Issues:** None

**Recommendations:**
- This is an exemplary E2E test that follows best practices
- The commit message and PR description clearly explain the rationale for no mocking
- CI pipeline fix ensures e2e tests always have a preview environment
- Test creates real data which properly validates end-to-end integration
