## Notes

**Commit Granularity:**

- This is the first of several task status update commits
- Could potentially be squashed with other status updates for cleaner git history
- However, individual commits provide clear audit trail of completion order

**Documentation Quality:**

- Brief but adequate
- Includes PR reference for traceability
- Follows established status update pattern

**Pattern Recognition:**

- This establishes the pattern for task completion updates
- Similar commits follow (c4b1532, b165a48, f172f4a, 084ce65, b145879)
- Consider if batch updates might be more efficient for future task tracking

This type of incremental status update commit is common in project management workflows, though multiple small updates could potentially be batched together.
