## Summary

Moves mcp-server from `turbo/packages/` to `turbo/apps/` to reflect its nature as a standalone application rather than a shared library.

## Review Against Bad Code Smells

### ✅ Project Structure
**Status: EXCELLENT**

**Proper Monorepo Organization:**
- `packages/` - Shared libraries (core, ui, config)
- `apps/` - Standalone applications (web, workspace, mcp-server)

**Before:** `packages/mcp-server` (incorrect - it's an app, not a library)
**After:** `apps/mcp-server` (correct - it's a standalone application)

### ✅ No Code Changes
**Status: GOOD**

This is a pure refactoring commit:
- No logic changes
- Only directory structure updates
- Import paths updated
- Configuration files updated

### All Categories: NOT APPLICABLE

This is infrastructure/organization change, not code changes.

## Final Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Proper monorepo organization**
✅ **Clear separation: apps vs packages**
✅ **No logic changes (pure refactor)**
✅ **All imports updated correctly**

## Verdict

**APPROVED ✅**

Clean refactoring that improves project organization.
