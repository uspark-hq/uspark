**Commit:** feat(api): implement yjs diff api for efficient real-time sync (#745)
**Author:** Ethan Zhang <ethan@uspark.ai>
**Date:** Fri Oct 24 21:25:44 2025 -0700

## Summary

Implements YJS diff API with server-side polling, reducing bandwidth by 97.5% (200KB/min → 5KB/min) by returning diffs instead of full documents.

## Changes Analysis

**Major additions:**
- New `/api/projects/:id/diff` endpoint with polling
- `project_versions` table for version snapshots
- 2 database migrations
- 7 comprehensive tests
- Performance documentation

**Total changes:** 13 files, +2,935 lines, -459 lines

## Review Against Bad Code Smells

### ✅ 2. Test Coverage
**Status: EXCELLENT**

**7 comprehensive tests:**
- Returns diff when version changed (200)
- Returns 304 when no changes after polling
- Returns 404 when version doesn't exist
- Diff can reconstruct document state
- Atomic transactions for version snapshots
- Cascade delete verification
- CORS headers properly exposed

All tests passing, good edge case coverage.

### ✅ 3. Error Handling
**Status: GOOD**

Proper status codes:
- 200: Diff available
- 304: No changes (not modified)
- 404: Version not found
- Fail-fast on database errors

### ✅ 4. Interface Changes
**Status: GOOD**

**New public endpoint:**
```typescript
GET /api/projects/:id/diff?fromVersion=X
Headers: X-From-Version, X-To-Version
```

Well-documented API contract with proper HTTP semantics.

### ✅ 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
**Status: ACCEPTABLE WITH NOTE**

**Polling implementation:**
```typescript
const maxPolls = isTestEnv ? 1 : 5;
const pollInterval = 1000; // 1 second
```

**Assessment:**
- Production: 5 polls with 1s intervals (max 5s)
- Test: 1 poll only (88ms, deterministic)

**Rationale:** Server-side polling is acceptable here because:
- Real-time sync requirement (alternative would be WebSockets)
- Test environment uses 1 poll (no artificial delays in tests)
- Max timeout is reasonable (5s)
- Returns 304 if no changes (proper HTTP caching)

**Not a violation** because:
- This is production polling logic, not test delays
- Tests run fast (1 poll only)
- Polling is the chosen architecture (documented in spec)

### ✅ 7. Database and Service Mocking
**Status: GOOD**

Tests use real database, no mocking of `globalThis.services`.

### ✅ 9. TypeScript `any` Usage
**Status: GOOD**

No `any` types detected.

### ✅ 11. Hardcoded URLs
**Status: GOOD**

No hardcoded URLs in production code.

### ✅ 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
**Status: ACCEPTABLE**

Tests use direct DB operations for setup, but test the API endpoint behavior (not DB operations directly).

### ✅ 13. Fail-Fast Pattern
**Status: GOOD**

- No fallback patterns
- Errors propagate properly
- 404 returned when version not found (not silent failure)

### ✅ 14. No Suppressions
**Status: GOOD**

No lint or type suppressions.

## Database Design Review

### ✅ Schema Quality
**Status: EXCELLENT**

```sql
CREATE TABLE project_versions (
  project_id uuid REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  version integer NOT NULL,
  ydoc_snapshot bytea NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(project_id, version)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_versions ON project_versions(project_id, version DESC);
```

**Strengths:**
- Proper foreign key with CASCADE delete
- Unique constraint prevents duplicates
- Index on (project_id, version DESC) for fast queries
- bytea type appropriate for binary YDoc snapshots

### ✅ Migration Quality
**Status: GOOD**

Two separate migrations:
1. Create table and index
2. Adjust constraints

Proper incremental approach.

## Performance Analysis

### Bandwidth Reduction ✅

**Before:** Sending full 200KB document every minute
**After:** Sending 5KB diff only

**Reduction:** 97.5% bandwidth savings

### Polling Strategy ✅

Server-side polling (max 5s) is reasonable for:
- Real-time sync requirements
- Avoiding WebSocket complexity
- HTTP/2 connection reuse
- 304 Not Modified caching

## Final Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **97.5% bandwidth reduction**
✅ **7 comprehensive tests, all passing**
✅ **Proper database schema with indices**
✅ **Atomic transactions for consistency**
✅ **Cascade delete handling**
✅ **CORS headers properly configured**
✅ **Test environment optimized (1 poll)**
✅ **Clear API documentation**
✅ **No `any` types or suppressions**

### Minor Observations

**Polling in production:** While server-side polling is acceptable for this use case, consider adding:
- Connection pooling metrics
- Rate limiting per user
- Monitoring for long-polling duration

## Verdict

**APPROVED ✅**

Excellent feature implementation that:
- Dramatically reduces bandwidth usage
- Maintains real-time sync capability
- Includes comprehensive tests
- Uses proper database design
- Follows project quality standards

---

## Code Quality Score: 95/100

Minor deduction for polling strategy complexity (acceptable trade-off for real-time sync without WebSockets).
