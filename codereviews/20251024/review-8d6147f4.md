## Summary

Corrects false positive in technical debt audit that incorrectly identified 45 actively-used workspace files as "legacy code."

## Changes Analysis

- `spec/tech-debt.md` - Corrected documentation (+41 lines, -19 lines)

## Documentation Quality Review

### ✅ Accuracy
**Status: EXCELLENT**

**Problem Identified:**
The January 2025 audit incorrectly flagged 45 workspace files (custom ESLint rules, signals) as unused legacy code.

**Evidence Provided:**
1. Custom ESLint rules enabled in `eslint.config.ts`
2. Signals actively imported by React components
3. Knip analysis: zero unused files
4. ccstate packages in production dependencies

### ✅ Investigation Quality
**Status: EXCELLENT**

Thorough verification:
- Checked ESLint configuration
- Verified signal imports
- Ran `pnpm knip -W apps/workspace`
- Confirmed production dependencies

### ✅ Impact

**Before:** 45 files incorrectly marked for deletion
**After:** Properly documented as active code

**Statistics Updated:**
- Medium priority issues: 3 → 2
- Resolved: 2 → 3

### Root Cause Analysis ✅

Identified why false positive occurred:
- High file count with unfamiliar pattern (ccstate)
- No actual usage analysis was performed
- Automated tooling misinterpretation

## Final Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Prevented accidental deletion of active code**
✅ **Thorough investigation with evidence**
✅ **Root cause analysis included**
✅ **Statistics properly updated**
✅ **Clear documentation of findings**

## Verdict

**APPROVED ✅**

Excellent corrective documentation that prevents potentially catastrophic code deletion.
