## Summary

This commit fixes a CSS truncation issue in the tool_use block display where long parameter values were not showing ellipsis correctly. The fix converts the outer div to a flexbox layout with `overflow-hidden`, wraps the tool name in a `shrink-0` span to prevent it from being truncated, and applies the `truncate` class only to the parameter display span where truncation should occur.

**Changes:**
- Modified `/turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/project/block-display.tsx`
- Changed outer div from `className="truncate text-[11px] text-[#9cdcfe]"` to `className="flex items-center gap-1 overflow-hidden text-[11px] text-[#9cdcfe]"`
- Wrapped tool name in `<span className="shrink-0">{toolName}</span>` to prevent truncation
- Moved `truncate` class from outer div to parameter display span: `<span className="truncate font-mono text-[#6a6a6a]">`
- Removed `ml-1` margin class in favor of flexbox `gap-1`

**Test Status:**
- All 17 existing tests in `block-display.test.tsx` pass
- No new tests added (visual fix)

## Review Against Bad Code Smells

### 1. Mock Analysis

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified in this commit. This is a pure implementation fix with no changes to test mocking patterns.

### 2. Test Coverage

**Status:** ⚠️ MINOR - Existing Tests Pass, No New Tests

**Analysis:**
- All 17 existing tests pass, indicating the change doesn't break existing functionality
- No new tests were added for the truncation behavior
- The fix is primarily a visual/CSS change that may be difficult to test in unit tests

**Consideration:**
- Visual regression testing would be ideal for this type of change
- Unit tests for CSS class application could be added but would test implementation details
- The change is low-risk given it only affects CSS layout without changing logic

### 3. Error Handling

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No error handling code was added or modified. This is a pure CSS/markup change.

### 4. Interface Changes

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No Breaking Changes

**Analysis:**
- The component's props interface (`BlockDisplayProps`) remains unchanged
- No changes to public API or exported interfaces
- The change is purely internal to the component's rendering
- Visual output changes for users (long parameters now truncate correctly), but this is a bug fix

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No Timers or Delays

No timers, delays, or time-based code introduced.

### 6. Dynamic Imports

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No Dynamic Imports

No import statements were added or modified. This change only affects JSX markup and CSS classes.

### 7. Database and Service Mocking in Web Tests

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified.

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified.

### 9. TypeScript `any` Usage

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No `any` Types

No TypeScript type changes were made. The code continues to use proper typing with no `any` types.

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified.

### 11. Hardcoded URLs and Configuration

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No configuration or URL handling code was modified.

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified.

### 13. Fail Fast Pattern

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No error handling or configuration code was modified.

### 14. Lint Suppressions

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No Suppressions

Reviewed the diff:
- No `// eslint-disable` comments
- No `// @ts-ignore` comments
- No `// @ts-expect-error` comments
- No `// @ts-nocheck` comments
- No `// prettier-ignore` comments
- No `// oxlint-disable` comments

All code passes linting and type checking without suppressions.

### 15. Bad Tests

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Not Applicable

No test files were modified.

## Technical Analysis

### CSS Implementation Review

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="truncate text-[11px] text-[#9cdcfe]">
  {toolName}
  {paramDisplay && (
    <span className="ml-1 font-mono text-[#6a6a6a]">
      {paramDisplay}
    </span>
  )}
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 overflow-hidden text-[11px] text-[#9cdcfe]">
  <span className="shrink-0">{toolName}</span>
  {paramDisplay && (
    <span className="truncate font-mono text-[#6a6a6a]">
      {paramDisplay}
    </span>
  )}
</div>
```

### Why the Original Didn't Work

The original implementation applied `truncate` to the parent div, which in the CSS cascade means:
- `text-overflow: ellipsis`
- `overflow: hidden`
- `white-space: nowrap`

This treats all children as a single text flow, so the ellipsis would appear at the end of the combined content (toolName + paramDisplay), but doesn't provide fine-grained control over which child should be truncated.

### Why the New Implementation Works

**Flexbox layout:**
- `flex items-center gap-1` creates a horizontal flex container with vertical centering and 1 unit gap
- `overflow-hidden` on the parent enables truncation for flex children

**Tool name protection:**
- `shrink-0` (flex-shrink: 0) prevents the tool name from being compressed or truncated
- Ensures tool names always display fully, which is important for readability

**Parameter truncation:**
- `truncate` class only on the `paramDisplay` span
- Since it's a flex child in a container with `overflow-hidden`, it can truncate independently
- Long parameter values (like TodoWrite with large JSON arrays) now show ellipsis correctly

### Tailwind CSS Classes Analysis

All classes used are standard Tailwind CSS utilities:
- `flex`, `items-center`, `gap-1` - Flexbox layout
- `overflow-hidden` - Required for truncation to work
- `shrink-0` - Prevents flex shrinking (flex-shrink: 0)
- `truncate` - Combines overflow-hidden, text-overflow-ellipsis, white-space-nowrap
- `text-[11px]` - Custom font size
- `text-[#9cdcfe]`, `text-[#6a6a6a]` - Custom colors (VS Code-like syntax highlighting)
- `font-mono` - Monospace font for parameters

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Minimal change** - Only modifies what's necessary to fix the issue
2. **No logic changes** - Pure CSS/markup modification
3. **Maintains existing behavior** - Tool names still display, parameters still show
4. **Improves UX** - Long parameters now truncate correctly with ellipsis
5. **Clean implementation** - Uses modern flexbox instead of hacky workarounds

**No issues found:**
- No TypeScript type issues
- No runtime logic changes
- No new dependencies
- No breaking changes
- All existing tests pass

## Verdict

- **Status:** ✅ APPROVED
- **Key Issues:** None
- **Minor Observations:**
  - No new tests for the visual change (acceptable for CSS fixes)
  - Visual regression testing would be ideal but not critical for this low-risk change

## Recommendations

### Strengths to Maintain:
1. **Minimal, focused change** - The fix addresses only the specific issue without over-engineering
2. **Modern CSS approach** - Uses flexbox appropriately for layout control
3. **Maintains backward compatibility** - All existing tests pass
4. **Clear commit message** - Well-documented what was fixed and how

### Optional Improvements:
1. **Visual regression tests** - Consider adding Playwright/Chromatic visual regression tests for UI components to catch these issues automatically
2. **Component documentation** - Could add comments explaining the flexbox layout requirements for proper truncation
3. **Storybook story** - If using Storybook, add a story demonstrating the truncation behavior with long parameters

### Testing Considerations:
While no new tests were added, the fix is:
- **Low risk** - Pure CSS change with no logic modifications
- **Validated** - All 17 existing tests pass
- **Observable** - Visual behavior is easily verified manually
- **Reversible** - Simple to revert if issues arise

**Recommendation for future:** For UI changes like this, consider:
- Screenshot tests in CI (Playwright visual comparison)
- Storybook stories showing edge cases (very long parameters)
- E2E tests that verify text truncation behavior if critical to UX

## Overall Assessment

This is a **clean, focused bug fix** that improves user experience without introducing technical debt or risks. The implementation:
- Uses modern CSS flexbox correctly
- Maintains component interface stability
- Passes all existing tests
- Follows project code quality standards
- Has clear documentation in commit message

**Recommendation: MERGE** - This commit is ready for production. The fix is minimal, well-implemented, and low-risk.
