# Code Review - 60fc098

**Commit**: `60fc0982e7627bfa9093885cc79c9b568712d386`
**Type**: chore
**PR**: #497
**Title**: remove unused e2b dockerfile

## Summary

This commit removes an obsolete E2B Dockerfile that was an early version lacking Claude Code CLI and uspark CLI installations. The project now uses `e2b.Dockerfile` instead as configured in `e2b.toml`.

## Changes

- Deleted `e2b/Dockerfile` (35 lines removed)
- The removed file was a basic template that:
  - Used `e2bdev/code-interpreter:latest` as base
  - Installed Node.js 20 LTS
  - Created basic workspace structure
  - Did NOT include Claude Code CLI or uspark CLI

## Code Quality Analysis

### âœ… Positive Aspects

1. **YAGNI Compliance**: Removes unused file rather than keeping it "just in case"
2. **Clean Deletion**: Completely removes the file instead of commenting it out or archiving
3. **Clear Documentation**: Commit message explains why the file was unused
4. **Verified Deletion**: Test plan confirms no other files reference the deleted Dockerfile

## Architecture Alignment

This change perfectly aligns with project principles:

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Core principle demonstrated - unused files are deleted, not archived
- **Simplicity**: Reduces confusion by having only one Dockerfile for E2B
- **Aggressive Deletion**: Follows the guideline "Delete unused code aggressively"

## Recommendations

âœ… **No changes needed** - This is exactly how unused code should be handled.

## Verdict

**APPROVED** âœ…

This is an exemplary cleanup commit. It demonstrates proper application of YAGNI principles by completely removing an obsolete file rather than keeping it around. The commit message clearly explains why the file was unused, and the test plan confirms the deletion is safe.
