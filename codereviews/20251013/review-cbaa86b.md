# Code Review - cbaa86b

**Commit**: `cbaa86b7e3b200341c12f8600b7180f19a4db5be`
**Type**: fix(ci)
**PR**: #498
**Title**: improve deployment cleanup to match all preview environments

## Summary

This commit fixes the deployment cleanup workflow to properly clean up all preview environment deployments when a PR is closed or merged. Previously, the workflow only searched by commit SHA, leaving many orphaned deployments.

## Changes

- Changed from searching deployments by specific commit SHA to fetching all deployments
- Added filtering logic to match deployments by multiple criteria:
  - Branch name (e.g., `fix/projects-ui-improvements`)
  - Full ref (e.g., `refs/heads/fix/projects-ui-improvements`)
  - Commit SHA
  - Environment name patterns (e.g., `preview/fix/projects-ui-improvements`)
- Added console logging for debugging and transparency

## Code Quality Analysis

### âœ… Positive Aspects

1. **Comprehensive Matching**: The new approach matches deployments by multiple criteria, ensuring thorough cleanup
2. **Clear Logging**: Added console.log statements to help debug the cleanup process
3. **Proper Context Usage**: Uses `context.payload.pull_request.head.ref` and `.sha` correctly
4. **Fail Fast**: No unnecessary try/catch blocks - lets errors propagate naturally

### ðŸŸ¡ Minor Concerns

#### 1. Console Logging in Production Code

**Location**: `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml:35, 53, 57`

```javascript
console.log(`Cleaning up deployments for branch: ${branchName}, sha: ${sha}`);
console.log(`Found ${branchDeployments.length} deployments to clean up`);
console.log(`Marking deployment ${deployment.id} (${deployment.environment}) as inactive`);
```

**Issue**: While console.log is acceptable in GitHub Actions scripts (since it's operational logging, not application code), this is worth noting.

**Severity**: Low - This is a CI workflow, not production application code
**Action**: Acceptable as-is for debugging purposes in CI

#### 2. Hardcoded Pagination Limit

**Location**: `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml:40`

```javascript
per_page: 100
```

**Issue**: If a repository has more than 100 deployments, this could miss some. However, this is unlikely for most use cases.

**Severity**: Low - Most PRs won't have 100+ deployments
**Recommendation**: Consider adding pagination if the project grows large enough to have 100+ active deployments

### ðŸŸ¢ No Major Issues Found

Reviewed against all bad code smell criteria:

1. **Mock Analysis**: N/A - No tests
2. **Test Coverage**: N/A - CI workflow
3. **Error Handling**: âœ… No defensive try/catch blocks - follows fail-fast principle
4. **Interface Changes**: N/A - No public interfaces
5. **Timer and Delay Analysis**: N/A - No timers
6. **Dynamic Import Analysis**: N/A - No imports
7. **Database Mocking**: N/A - No tests
8. **Test Mock Cleanup**: N/A - No tests
9. **TypeScript `any` Type**: N/A - JavaScript
10. **Artificial Delays**: N/A - No delays
11. **Hardcoded URLs**: N/A - No URLs
12. **Direct Database Operations**: N/A - No database
13. **Fallback Patterns**: âœ… No fallback logic - fails fast if deployments can't be fetched
14. **Lint/Type Suppressions**: âœ… No suppressions
15. **Bad Tests**: N/A - No tests

## Architecture Alignment

This change aligns with project principles:

- **Fail Fast**: No defensive error handling - lets API errors propagate
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward filtering logic without over-engineering
- **Clear Intent**: Code clearly expresses what it's doing

## Recommendations

### Optional Improvements

1. **Add Pagination Support** (if needed in future):
   ```javascript
   let page = 1;
   let allDeployments = [];
   while (true) {
     const result = await github.rest.repos.listDeployments({
       owner: context.repo.owner,
       repo: context.repo.repo,
       per_page: 100,
       page: page
     });
     allDeployments.push(...result.data);
     if (result.data.length < 100) break;
     page++;
   }
   ```

2. **Consider Structured Logging** (optional):
   Since this is a GitHub Actions script, console.log is acceptable. However, for better structure, you could use GitHub Actions annotations.

## Verdict

**APPROVED** âœ…

This is a solid bug fix that improves the reliability of the deployment cleanup process. The code is clear, follows fail-fast principles, and doesn't introduce any of the bad code smells we watch for. The logging helps with debugging, and the multiple matching criteria ensure comprehensive cleanup.

The minor concerns (pagination limit and console logging) are acceptable for a CI workflow and don't require immediate action.
