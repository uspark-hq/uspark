**Commit**: 72896d79c7c39134f49baa3d70b2c8b627eaa45f
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Redesigned workspace page layout to maximize chat window space. Moved file tree to a popover and implemented dynamic split view (chat | file content) when files are selected. Follows ccstate architecture patterns for state management.

## Code Smells Found

None detected. The implementation follows best practices.

## Positive Observations

1. **Clean State Management**: Uses ccstate patterns correctly with computed signals and commands
2. **Proper Event Handling**: Click-outside and ESC key detection use AbortSignal for cleanup
3. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
4. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type
5. **Component Composition**: Good separation of concerns between FileTreePopover, FileContent, and ProjectPage
6. **Accessibility**: Proper aria-labels for buttons
7. **Visual Design**: Follows VS Code theme styling consistently

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Clean implementation with no code smells detected.
