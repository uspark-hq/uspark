# Code Review: fix(initial-scan): trigger scan for public repositories

**Commit**: 261856b924682fd53a465c771471902f862b0173
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Fixed bug where public repositories were not being scanned during project creation. Made `installationId` optional and added conditional token usage for git clone.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Bug Fix**: Public repos now properly trigger initial scan
2. **Conditional Logic**: Uses token only when available (private repos)
3. **Test Coverage**: Added tests for public repository scenarios
4. **Type Safety**: Made `installationId: number | null` explicit
5. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
6. **All Tests Passing**: 10/10 initial-scan-executor tests, 13/13 route tests

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent bug fix with proper test coverage and clean implementation.
