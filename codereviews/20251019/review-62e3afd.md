**Commit**: 62e3afdb0043419aaaa6296e6a7f74884040501d
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Fixed Claude execution timeout on Vercel by increasing function timeout to 5 minutes and adding comprehensive logging. Reverted fire-and-forget approach to use proper `await` to ensure execution completes.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Proper Timeout**: Increased `maxDuration` to 300 seconds (5 minutes) for long-running operations
2. **Detailed Logging**: Added logs at each execution stage for debugging
3. **Correct Async Handling**: Reverted incorrect fire-and-forget pattern to proper `await`
4. **Test Fixes**: Removed obsolete `startedAt` field and `in_progress` status references
5. **Rationale**: Clear explanation of why fire-and-forget doesn't work in Vercel serverless

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Important fix that ensures Claude execution completes properly in Vercel environment.
