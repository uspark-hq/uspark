# Code Review: refactor(e2b): extract claude turn execution to unified shell script

**Commit**: 7de604971af0b90c93c6d179f657e060b6bb3e8f
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Consolidated all E2B execution commands into single unified shell script (`e2b/execute-claude-turn.sh`). Simplified E2B executor code from ~540 lines to ~400 lines by removing inline bash string generation.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Code Organization**: All execution logic in one maintainable script
2. **Readability**: ~150 lines less inline bash string generation
3. **Testability**: Script can be tested independently outside E2B
4. **Transparency**: Clear linear workflow (sync → execute → cleanup)
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Executor orchestrates, script executes
6. **Fixed Paths**: No modes or options, single execution path
7. **Environment Variables**: Clear separation between sandbox creation and execution vars

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent refactoring that significantly improves maintainability and testability.
