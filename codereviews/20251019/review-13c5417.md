**Commit**: 13c541797a731aca61da200c27cfa02e12e6ef10
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Replaced native HTML `<select>` with custom dropdown component that matches VS Code dark theme. Uses ccstate signals pattern for state management with click-outside and keyboard navigation support.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Clean State Management**: Uses ccstate signals instead of React hooks
2. **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support with proper roles
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for Enter/Space/Escape keys
4. **Click-Outside Detection**: Uses AbortSignal for proper cleanup
5. **VS Code Theme Consistency**: Matches existing color scheme
6. **Test Updates**: Properly updated tests for new dropdown roles
7. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
8. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Well-implemented custom dropdown with proper accessibility and state management.
