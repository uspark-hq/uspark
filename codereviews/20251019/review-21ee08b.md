# Code Review: feat(e2b): sync project files on every turn with comprehensive logging

**Commit**: 21ee08bb3000bb2e1f07b0568f3a6e0e599751ec
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Added `syncProjectFiles()` method to ensure code is always up-to-date before Claude execution. Implements comprehensive logging to timestamped files in `/tmp` for all sync and execution operations.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Automatic Sync**: Ensures Claude always works with latest code
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged to timestamped files
3. **Error Handling**: Proper logging of errors without silent failures
4. **Git Pull Integration**: Automatically pulls latest changes when reconnecting
5. **Timestamp-based Logs**: Prevents log file conflicts
6. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
7. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent improvement that ensures code synchronization and provides full visibility into container operations.
