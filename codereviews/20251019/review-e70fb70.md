## Summary
Fixed critical issues with Claude CLI execution logging by capturing stderr and ensuring correct working directory. Uses subshell syntax to make `cd` command persist for entire pipeline execution.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Error Visibility**: Captures stderr with `2>&1` redirect to see authentication failures and API errors
2. **Working Directory Fix**: Uses subshell `()` syntax to ensure `cd` persists
3. **Debugging Aid**: Logs working directory to `/tmp/pwd.log` for verification
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Pure bug fix that improves observability
5. **Shell Best Practices**: Proper use of subshell for directory context

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Important bug fix that improves debugging capabilities and error visibility.
