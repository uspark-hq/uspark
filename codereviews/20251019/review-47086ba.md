# Code Review: fix(api): standardize api response field naming to snake_case

**Commit**: 47086ba5254dc28418326477f7a13ab971d6dc33
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Fixed "Invalid Date" display issue by standardizing all API response field naming to `snake_case`. Zod validation was failing because APIs returned snake_case while contracts expected camelCase.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Consistency**: Standardized all API responses to snake_case
2. **Bug Fix**: Resolved "Invalid Date" display issue caused by field name mismatch
3. **Comprehensive**: Updated all contracts, routes, frontend code, and tests
4. **Test Coverage**: Added test specifically to verify field naming consistency
5. **All Tests Passing**: 44/229 web tests, 12/175 workspace tests passing
6. **Type Safety**: Zod schemas now properly validate snake_case fields

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Thorough fix that standardizes API naming conventions project-wide and includes validation tests.
