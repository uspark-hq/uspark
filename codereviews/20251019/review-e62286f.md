# Code Review: feat(sessions): optimize turn state management and add interrupt functionality

**Commit**: e62286fedfc8192c9dcce42ff79aee94c7697e16
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Optimized turn state management by merging `pending` and `in_progress` into single `running` state. Added interrupt functionality to stop Claude execution. Auto-cancels previous running turns when creating new turn.

## Code Smells Found

### Error Handling Pattern
- **Location**: turbo/apps/web/src/lib/e2b-executor.ts:441-442
- **Issue**: try/catch with "Don't throw - this is best-effort cleanup" comment
- **Recommendation**: While the comment justifies the pattern for cleanup operations, consider whether failing silently is appropriate. The error is logged but consumers don't know cleanup failed.

## Positive Observations

1. **State Simplification**: Reduced complexity by merging two states into one
2. **Database Migration**: Clean migration (0015) to update existing data
3. **Test Updates**: All tests updated for new status names
4. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type
5. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
6. **API Consistency**: Proper 409 status for conflict scenarios
7. **Fail-Fast Command**: Uses `|| true` in pkill command to prevent failures when processes don't exist

## Overall Assessment
**Minor Issues** - Good refactoring with one minor error handling consideration. The silent failure in interruptSession is acceptable for cleanup but should be monitored.
