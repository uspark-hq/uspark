# Code Review: refactor(e2b): implement idempotent workspace initialization in execute-claude-turn.sh

**Commit**: 6cebb90b447453c7969b9ca27d346685db28446f
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Consolidated workspace initialization logic into `execute-claude-turn.sh` for idempotent execution. Removed unused scripts (`init.sh`, `initialize-workspace.sh`) and simplified `e2b-executor.ts` by removing `initializeSandbox` method.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Idempotent Design**: Safe to run multiple times with consistent results
2. **Always Up-to-Date**: Latest code synced before each turn
3. **Code Reduction**: Net -90 lines of code
4. **Single Script**: Consolidated all execution logic
5. **Removed Unused Code**: Deleted scripts that were never executed due to E2B's snapshot mechanism
6. **Git Operations**: Proper use of `git reset --hard` + `git pull` for syncing

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent refactoring that simplifies architecture and ensures code is always current.
