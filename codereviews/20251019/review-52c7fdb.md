**Commit**: 52c7fdbf86e010ff29cc727a0aa885e590001e5d
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Simplified turn block UI by removing emoji from all block types and replacing collapse/expand logic with consistent max-height and scrollbar approach. Tests updated to match new simpler behavior.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Test Updates**: Properly updated tests to reflect new behavior (removed collapse/expand tests)
2. **Simplified Logic**: Removed unnecessary useState hooks for collapse state
3. **Consistency**: Applied changes to both web and workspace apps uniformly
4. **Code Reduction**: Reduced complexity by 116 lines (-46% in tests, -54% in component logic)
5. **No Bad Test Patterns**: Removed tests for implementation details (collapse state), kept meaningful behavioral tests

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Clean refactoring that simplifies UI logic and removes unnecessary complexity.
