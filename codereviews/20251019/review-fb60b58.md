**Commit**: fb60b58aa980a624e204bb1554b3eeb6d90bf262
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Enabled initial repository scanning for public GitHub repositories. Previously only repositories with GitHub App installation would trigger scans.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Feature Parity**: Public repos now have same scanning experience as installed repos
2. **Optional Parameter**: Made `installationId` optional to support public repos
3. **HTTPS Cloning**: Public repos clone without authentication token
4. **Test Coverage**: Updated all tests (9 executor tests, 12 route tests, 11 frontend tests)
5. **Consistent UX**: Same scanning flow regardless of repository type

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Clean feature implementation with proper test coverage.
