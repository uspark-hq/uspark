# Code Review: refactor(cli): optimize watch-claude to use batch file push

**Commit**: 1779dc30646cae1e423c582b2b2a5baf6f93b6af
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Refactored watch-claude from real-time file synchronization to batch push on completion. Extracted `pushAllFiles()` to shared module, simplified codebase by 262 lines (-36%), and updated all tests to verify batch push behavior.

## Code Smells Found

None detected. The refactoring follows best practices.

## Positive Observations

1. **Code Reuse**: Extracted `pushAllFiles()` to shared.ts for use by both watch-claude and sync commands
2. **Performance Improvement**: Reduces network requests from N (per file) to 1 (batch operation)
3. **Test Updates**: Properly updated all tests (29/29 passing) to match new behavior
4. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex file tracking state machine for cleaner implementation
5. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports remain static
6. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type
7. **Test Quality**: Tests verify actual behavior (batch push) rather than implementation details
8. **No Artificial Delays**: Tests use vi.waitFor() for async operations without fake timers

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent refactoring that improves code quality, performance, and maintainability.
