# Code Review: feat(projects): add intelligent GitHub repository import with unified input

**Commit**: ddbf9a8a366b53b44836128a413305b25991d677
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Simplified project creation flow with intelligent repository detection that automatically determines whether a GitHub repository is accessible via user installations or as a public repository. Reduced from 3 options to 2 with unified input.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Smart Fallback Logic**: First checks installations, then falls back to public repo check (acceptable fallback for user experience)
2. **Multiple Format Support**: Handles various input formats (owner/repo, HTTPS URLs, SSH URLs)
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Specific error types and descriptions for each failure scenario
4. **Type Safety**: Proper Zod validation for request schema
5. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
6. **Clean API Design**: RESTful endpoint with appropriate status codes (401, 400, 404, 403, 502)
7. **User Experience**: Eliminated need for users to know their repository access type

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Excellent implementation that improves user experience while maintaining code quality.
