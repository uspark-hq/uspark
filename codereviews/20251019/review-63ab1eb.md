**Commit**: 63ab1eb20394fedc224619311b18c89856069c1d
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Implemented frontend filtering to hide tool execution details in Claude chat UI. Hides all `tool_use` blocks and keeps only last `tool_result` block per turn for cleaner conversation flow.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Clean Algorithm**: O(n) time complexity with two-pass filtering
2. **Test Coverage**: 9 comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases
3. **Reusable Utility**: Extracted to core package for consistency
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing with null/undefined checks
5. **All Tests Passing**: 9 new tests + all existing tests
6. **UX Improvement**: Cleaner conversation view without implementation details

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Well-designed feature with excellent test coverage and clean implementation.
