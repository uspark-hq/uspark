**Commit**: df2e9e3a384c08e4b51b6fb6b64322f288cd6e65
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Added back button in top-left corner of project detail page that navigates back to project list. Handles domain switching from app.uspark.com to www.uspark.com correctly.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Domain Switching**: Properly handles subdomain change from app to www
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests added for back button functionality
3. **Layout Update**: Changed from `justify-end` to `justify-between` for balanced layout
4. **No Dynamic Imports**: All imports are static
5. **Type Safety**: No use of `any` type
6. **Clean Implementation**: Simple navigation logic with proper URL handling

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Clean implementation with good test coverage and proper domain handling.
