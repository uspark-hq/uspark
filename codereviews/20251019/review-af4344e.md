# Code Review: feat(workspace): implement auto-scroll for turn list updates

**Commit**: af4344e2d99261cecca9911ea5ec6313b5533245
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Summary
Implemented automatic scrolling to bottom when turn list updates. Created `triggerReloadTurn$` command to centralize turn reload logic with auto-scroll functionality. Uses `delay(0)` from signal-timers to wait for DOM updates.

## Code Smells Found

None detected.

## Positive Observations

1. **Centralized Logic**: Single `triggerReloadTurn$` command for consistency
2. **Proper Timing**: Uses `delay(0)` to wait for DOM updates before scrolling
3. **AbortSignal Handling**: Proper cleanup throughout
4. **Test Coverage**: 111 tests with proper cancellation testing
5. **Future Ready**: State ready for toggle control (not yet exposed)
6. **All Tests Passing**: 180 passed | 1 skipped (181 total)
7. **No Artificial Delays**: Uses `delay(0)` appropriately, not fake timers

## Overall Assessment
**Pass** - Well-implemented auto-scroll feature with proper signal handling and test coverage.
