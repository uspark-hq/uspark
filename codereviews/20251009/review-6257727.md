**Commit**: refactor: remove success output from watch-claude to keep stdout clean
**Author**: Yuchen
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Removes success messages from watch-claude to keep stdout clean. Only errors are logged to stderr now.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ YAGNI Principle - Code Deletion

Small but focused cleanup:
- Removed 11 lines
- Added 2 lines
- Net: -9 lines

### ✅ Clean Design - Proper Use of stdout vs stderr

The change correctly implements Unix pipe conventions:
- stdout: Only Claude's JSON output (clean data stream)
- stderr: Only errors (when something goes wrong)
- Removed: Success messages that polluted stderr

This is the correct behavior for a pipe tool.

### ✅ Test Updates

Tests updated to remove expectations for success messages that are no longer output.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Unix Philosophy**: Follows Unix pipe conventions correctly

2. **Silent on Success**: Tool is now silent when working correctly, which is ideal for pipes

3. **Errors Still Logged**: Error messages still go to stderr for debugging

4. **Test Coverage Maintained**: Tests updated to match new behavior

## Recommendations

None - this is the correct behavior for a pipe tool.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

Proper implementation of Unix pipe conventions. The tool now correctly outputs only data to stdout and only errors to stderr.
