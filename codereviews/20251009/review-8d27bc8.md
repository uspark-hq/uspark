**Commit**: test: mock process.exit to prevent vitest unhandled error warnings
**Author**: Yuchen
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

This commit mocks `process.exit` in watch-claude tests to prevent Vitest from treating actual exits as unhandled errors.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ 8. Test Mock Cleanup

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.test.ts:24-28`

**Good**: The mock is properly added to `beforeEach`, ensuring it's set up for each test:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, "error").mockImplementation(() => {});
  // Mock process.exit to prevent actual exit and Vitest errors
  vi.spyOn(process, "exit").mockImplementation(() => undefined as never);
});
```

This follows best practices:
- Mock is created in `beforeEach`
- Combined with `vi.clearAllMocks()` call
- Prevents process.exit from actually terminating the test process

### ✅ 1. Mock Analysis - Appropriate Mock

This is a **necessary mock** because:
- `process.exit()` would terminate the test runner
- There's no alternative to prevent actual process termination in tests
- The mock doesn't replace business logic - it prevents test infrastructure issues
- This is infrastructure-level mocking, not application logic mocking

## Positive Aspects

1. **Necessary Fix**: Without this mock, tests would actually exit the process when the close handler fires

2. **Type Safety**: Uses proper type assertion `() => undefined as never` to match process.exit signature

3. **Proper Placement**: Added in `beforeEach` with other mocks

4. **Clear Comment**: Explains why the mock is needed

## Recommendations

None - this is a necessary and properly implemented test mock.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

A necessary test infrastructure fix that prevents process termination during test execution.
