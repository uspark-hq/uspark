**Commit**: refactor: remove web project detail page and redirect to workspace
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Removes the web project detail page as it's been replaced by the workspace application. Redirects to workspace subdomain instead.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ YAGNI Principle - Massive Simplification

Excellent application of code deletion:
- Removed 1,579 lines of code
- Added only 14 lines
- Net deletion: -1,565 lines

Removed:
- Entire `/projects/[id]` page and tests (594 test lines, 437 page lines)
- Unused `github-sync-button` component (522 lines)
- Unused `file-explorer` index file

### ✅ Test Updates - Proper Refactoring

**Location**: `turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/project/test-helpers.ts:4`

Fixed workspace lint errors by adding proper type annotations:
- Added yjs type annotations
- Removed testing-library warnings
- Eliminated direct DOM access

### ✅ Type Safety Improvements

The commit fixes type safety issues in workspace that were causing lint errors.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Aggressive Code Deletion**: Removes entire feature that was superseded

2. **Clean Redirect**: Simple redirect to workspace subdomain

3. **Fixes Pre-existing Issues**: Addresses workspace lint errors mentioned in commit 6ad23bc

4. **Dependency Management**: Adds missing yjs dev dependency

## Recommendations

None - this is excellent cleanup work.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

Exemplary refactoring that removes obsolete code and fixes pre-existing lint issues. This likely addresses the lint errors that caused the hook bypass in commit 6ad23bc.
