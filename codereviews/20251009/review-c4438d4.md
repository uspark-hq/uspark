**Commit**: test: fix navigation tests to use workspace subdomain
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Updates project list page tests to expect subdomain navigation instead of router.push, aligning with the refactor to workspace app.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ Test Updates - Proper Refactoring

Tests updated to match the new subdomain redirect behavior:
- Changed from mocking `router.push` to mocking `window.location.href`
- Updated assertions to check workspace URL format
- Fixed 3 failing tests

### ✅ 8. Test Mock Cleanup

**Location**: Implicit through test updates

The tests were updated to use the correct mock (window.location instead of router.push), which is the appropriate mock for subdomain redirects.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Tests Match Implementation**: Tests now correctly verify subdomain redirect behavior

2. **Proper Mock Usage**: Uses `window.location.href` mock instead of router mock, which is correct for cross-domain navigation

3. **All Tests Passing**: Fixed 3 failing tests

## Recommendations

None - tests correctly updated to match implementation.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

Proper test updates to match the subdomain redirect refactoring from commit 947c4de.
