**Commit**: refactor: change github sync to only create dedicated repositories
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Simplifies GitHub integration by removing the ability to link existing repositories, only supporting auto-created dedicated repositories.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ YAGNI Principle - Excellent Application

This commit is a perfect example of **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**:
- Removes complexity that wasn't needed (linking existing repos)
- Simplifies to the essential functionality (dedicated repos only)
- Deletes unused code and routes
- Reduces total lines of code significantly

Changes:
- Deleted `/api/github/repositories` route (75 lines removed)
- Removed `linkExistingRepository()` and `getInstallationRepositories()` functions
- Simplified UI from repository selector to simple "Create Repository" button
- Updated tests to match new simpler behavior

### ✅ 1. Mock Analysis - Test Mocks Updated

Test mocks were updated to match the new simpler behavior:
- Removed mocks for linking existing repositories
- Updated mocks for createProjectRepository
- Tests now only cover the single happy path

This is appropriate as the tests match the actual functionality.

### ✅ Type Safety Maintained

All changes maintain strict TypeScript typing throughout.

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - Clean

No unnecessary try/catch blocks. Errors propagate naturally.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Simplification**: Reduces code complexity significantly
   - 251 additions vs 409 deletions = net -158 lines
   - Removes entire API route
   - Simplifies UI component

2. **Safety Improvement**: Dedicated repositories provide better isolation between uSpark docs and user code

3. **Documentation Updated**: Updates spec files to reflect new approach
   - `spec/issues/github-sync.md`
   - `spec/issues/github.md`
   - `spec/issues/mvp.md`

4. **Test Coverage Maintained**: Tests updated to cover the new simpler flow

5. **YAGNI in Action**: Perfect example of removing features that added complexity without clear value

## Recommendations

None - this is an exemplary refactoring that simplifies the codebase.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

An excellent refactoring that demonstrates proper application of YAGNI principles. Reduces complexity while improving safety and maintainability.
