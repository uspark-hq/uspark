**Commit**: fix: improve CLI sync reliability and CORS handling (#441)
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

This commit improves CLI sync reliability by handling duplicate blob uploads and fixing watch-claude file sync timing. It also enhances CORS to support wildcard subdomains.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - Appropriate Use of try/catch

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/project-sync.ts:257-272` and `apps/cli/src/project-sync.ts:397-410`

The try/catch blocks added here are **appropriate** and follow best practices:
- They catch a **specific error** (blob already exists)
- They provide **meaningful error handling** (skip duplicate, continue operation)
- They **re-throw unexpected errors** instead of swallowing them
- This enables **idempotency** for the push operation

This is a good example of when try/catch should be used:
```typescript
try {
  await put(blobPath, content, {
    access: "public",
    token: blobToken,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Specific error handling
  if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes("blob already exists")) {
    // Gracefully skip - this is OK
  } else {
    throw error; // Re-throw unexpected errors
  }
}
```

### ✅ 4. Interface Changes - Event Type Extension

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.ts:6-21`

Added new event types to handle async file operations:
- Added `"tool_result"` to event type union
- Added `tool_use_id` and `content` fields to ClaudeEvent interface
- This is a backward-compatible interface extension

### ⚠️ 11. Hardcoded URLs and Configuration (Minor)

**Location**: `apps/web/middleware.cors.ts:10-16`

While the code adds hardcoded URLs to the `allowedOrigins` array, this is mitigated by:
- The new `isOriginAllowed()` function that provides dynamic subdomain matching
- The wildcard pattern matching for `*.uspark.ai` and `*.uspark.dev`

However, consider moving these to environment configuration in the future for better flexibility.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Race Condition Fix**: The watch-claude timing fix properly addresses a race condition by:
   - Tracking tool_use events with their IDs
   - Deferring sync until tool_result arrives
   - Using a Map to track pending operations

2. **Idempotency**: The duplicate blob handling makes push operations idempotent, which is excellent for reliability

3. **Type Safety**: All changes maintain strict TypeScript typing

4. **Clean Architecture**: The separation of concerns between tracking pending operations and syncing files is well-designed

## Recommendations

None - this is a solid commit that fixes real issues with appropriate solutions.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

This commit demonstrates good software engineering practices:
- Proper error handling with specific error detection
- Race condition fix with proper async tracking
- Type-safe interface extensions
- Idempotent operations for reliability
