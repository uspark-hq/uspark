**Commit**: fix: handle CORS preflight before redirects
**Author**: Yuchen
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

This commit fixes CORS preflight request handling by processing OPTIONS requests before Clerk middleware can trigger redirects.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - No Defensive Programming

The code correctly avoids unnecessary try/catch blocks and lets the framework handle CORS responses naturally.

### ✅ Clean Solution

**Location**: `apps/web/middleware.ts:16-22`

The fix is elegant and minimal:
```typescript
// Handle CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests BEFORE any other processing
if (
  request.method === "OPTIONS" &&
  request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/api/")
) {
  return handleCors(request);
}
```

This follows the "fail fast" principle by:
- Checking the condition early
- Returning immediately when applicable
- Avoiding complex nested logic

## Positive Aspects

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: The commit message clearly identifies the root cause (Clerk middleware redirects interfering with CORS preflight)

2. **Minimal Change**: The fix is a simple early return that doesn't complicate the middleware logic

3. **Correct HTTP Semantics**: Properly handles OPTIONS method for CORS preflight according to HTTP specifications

4. **No Over-Engineering**: Doesn't add unnecessary abstraction or complexity

## Recommendations

None - this is a focused fix for a specific CORS issue.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

A clean, focused fix that addresses the root cause without over-engineering.
