**Commit**: fix: correct tool_result event parsing in watch-claude
**Author**: Yuchen
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Fixes incorrect parsing of tool_result events from Claude CLI. The events come as `type:'user'` with content arrays, not as top-level `type:'tool_result'`.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - No Defensive Programming

The code maintains clean error handling without unnecessary try/catch blocks.

### ✅ Type Safety - Good Type Narrowing

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.ts:120-125`

Proper type narrowing for extracting tool_use_id:
```typescript
const toolUseId =
  contentItem.type === "tool_result" &&
  "tool_use_id" in contentItem &&
  typeof contentItem.tool_use_id === "string"
    ? contentItem.tool_use_id
    : null;
```

This is excellent type-safe code that:
- Checks the content type
- Verifies the property exists
- Validates the type is string
- Uses const assertion for better type inference

No use of `any` type or unsafe type assertions.

### ✅ 4. Interface Changes - Type Definition Update

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.ts:18`

Updated interface to include `tool_use_id` in content items:
```typescript
content: Array<{
  type: "text" | "tool_use" | "tool_result";
  // ... other fields
  tool_use_id?: string; // For tool_result items
}>;
```

Clean, backward-compatible type extension.

### ❌ 10. Artificial Delays in Tests (Inherited)

The tests updated here still contain the artificial delays from commit ab8c5f2. This was already flagged in that review.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Bug Fix Based on Actual Data**: The fix is based on real Claude CLI output format

2. **Type-Safe Implementation**: Uses proper type narrowing instead of type assertions

3. **Comprehensive Test Updates**: All tests updated to match the correct JSON format

4. **Clear Documentation**: Comment explains the event format:
   ```typescript
   // tool_result events come as type:"user" with content containing tool_result items
   ```

5. **Proper Event Structure Handling**: Correctly iterates through content array to find tool_result items

## Recommendations

### Inherited from ab8c5f2

1. **Remove Artificial Delays**: The tests should not use `setTimeout` for synchronization

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

A necessary bug fix that correctly implements the Claude CLI event format. The implementation is type-safe and well-documented. The artificial delay issue is inherited from the previous commit and was already flagged.
