**Commit**: fix: ensure watch-claude waits for async file syncs to complete
**Author**: Yuchen
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

This commit fixes a critical async handling bug where watch-claude was exiting before file sync operations completed. It also adds comprehensive tests.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ❌ 10. Artificial Delays in Tests

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.test.ts:87-88`, `157-158`, `210-211`

**Issue**: Tests use artificial delays with `setTimeout`:
```typescript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
// ...
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
```

**Why This is Bad**:
- Artificial delays make tests flaky and slow
- The 200ms delay is arbitrary - might fail on slow CI
- Tests should wait for actual conditions, not arbitrary time periods
- Violates the "no artificial delays in tests" principle from bad-smell.md

**Recommended Fix**:
Tests should use proper event sequencing instead of delays. For example:
- Wait for the actual sync operation to complete
- Use promises that resolve when the expected action occurs
- Mock `syncFile` to return a promise you can control

Example of better approach:
```typescript
// Instead of arbitrary delay:
// await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200));

// Better: Control the sync operation
const syncComplete = vi.fn();
vi.mocked(syncFile).mockImplementation(async () => {
  syncComplete();
});

// Emit events
mockStdin.push(toolUseEvent + "\n");
mockStdin.push(toolResultEvent + "\n");
mockStdin.push(null); // Close stream

// Wait for command completion
await commandPromise;

// Verify sync was called
expect(syncFile).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

### ✅ 8. Test Mock Cleanup

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.test.ts:24`

**Good**: Tests properly clear mocks in `beforeEach`:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, "error").mockImplementation(() => {});
});
```

### ⚠️ 15. Console Output Mocking Without Assertions (Partial)

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.test.ts:25`

The test mocks `console.error` and sometimes verifies output:
```typescript
consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, "error").mockImplementation(() => {});
// Later:
expect(consoleErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining("[uspark] ✓ Synced spec/test-time.md"),
);
```

This is **acceptable** because:
- The mock is used with assertions (line 114-116)
- It prevents test output pollution
- Assertions verify the expected log messages

However, the spy is reused across tests but not all tests assert on it.

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - Good Use of try/catch

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.ts:120-148`

**Good**: The try/catch block serves a specific purpose:
- Catches specific errors during file sync
- Logs meaningful error messages
- Uses finally block to ensure cleanup
- Doesn't swallow errors silently

This is appropriate error handling that provides visibility into failures.

**Location**: `apps/cli/src/commands/watch-claude.ts:154-156`

**Good**: Silently skipping non-JSON lines is appropriate here:
```typescript
} catch {
  // Silently skip non-JSON lines
}
```

This is acceptable because watch-claude processes a stream that may contain mixed JSON and non-JSON output.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Critical Bug Fix**: Properly addresses the race condition between readline close and pending async operations

2. **Promise Tracking**: Clean implementation using array to track pending promises:
   ```typescript
   const pendingSyncs: Array<Promise<void>> = [];
   ```

3. **Proper Cleanup**: Uses `finally` block to ensure promises are removed from tracking

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Tests cover multiple scenarios (successful sync, missing tool_result, non-file tools)

5. **Type Safety**: All changes maintain strict TypeScript typing

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Remove Artificial Delays from Tests**: Replace `setTimeout` with proper async control flow
   - Use promise-based synchronization
   - Wait for actual operations to complete
   - Don't rely on arbitrary time delays

### Low Priority

2. **Consider Timeout**: Add a maximum wait time for pending syncs to prevent the command from hanging indefinitely if a sync never completes

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ⚠️ APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

The core functionality fix is excellent and solves a real problem. However, the tests use artificial delays which violate project standards and should be refactored to use proper async handling.

The production code changes are solid and follow best practices.
