**Commit**: feat: add terminal-style landing page
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Replaces the traditional marketing landing page with an interactive terminal interface using react-console-emulator.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ⚠️ Important Note from Commit Message

The commit message states:
> "Note: Pre-commit hook bypassed due to pre-existing lint errors in workspace app (unrelated to this change). All web app changes pass lint/type checks."

This violates the project guideline of zero tolerance for lint violations and bypassing checks. However, this appears to be acknowledging pre-existing issues rather than introducing new ones.

### ✅ 1. Mock Analysis - No New Mocks

No test mocks added in this commit.

### ✅ Clean Component Implementation

**Location**: `apps/web/app/components/TerminalHome.tsx`

The terminal component is well-structured:
- Uses proper TypeScript types
- Clean command definition pattern
- Appropriate use of client component for interactivity
- Good separation of concerns

### ✅ Type Safety

**Location**: `apps/web/app/components/react-console-emulator.d.ts`

Proper TypeScript type definitions added for the third-party library:
```typescript
declare module "react-console-emulator" {
  // ... proper type definitions
}
```

This maintains type safety instead of using `any`.

### ✅ 3. Error Handling - No Defensive Programming

No unnecessary try/catch blocks added.

## Positive Aspects

1. **Massive Code Deletion**: Removes 1,891 lines and adds only 256 lines - excellent simplification

2. **Type Safety**: Adds proper type definitions for third-party library

3. **Clean Architecture**: Separates TerminalHome into its own component

4. **User Experience**: Creates a developer-friendly first impression

## Concerns

### ⚠️ Pre-commit Hook Bypass

The commit message indicates pre-commit hooks were bypassed. While the message claims the web app changes pass checks, this practice should be avoided. The proper approach would be:
1. Fix the pre-existing lint errors in workspace app first
2. Then commit the new changes
3. Never bypass hooks

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Address Pre-existing Lint Errors**: Fix the workspace app lint errors that caused the hook bypass

2. **Verify Clean State**: Run `pnpm turbo run lint` to ensure no lint violations exist

### Low Priority

3. **Consider Server-Side Rendering**: The terminal component is client-only. Consider if any parts could be server-rendered for better SEO.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONCERNS

The code changes themselves are clean and well-implemented. The major concern is the pre-commit hook bypass, which violates project guidelines. The team should address the pre-existing lint errors that caused this.

The actual implementation is solid with good type safety and clean architecture.
