**Commit**: fix: resolve help command conflict and add comprehensive tests
**Author**: Ethan Zhang
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Summary

Removes custom help command to avoid conflicts with library's built-in help. Adds comprehensive tests for TerminalHome component.

## Bad Code Smells Analysis

### ✅ 8. Test Mock Cleanup

**Location**: `turbo/apps/web/app/components/__tests__/TerminalHome.test.tsx:48-55`

Proper mock cleanup in `beforeEach`:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  (useRouter as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>).mockReturnValue({
    push: mockPush,
  });
  global.window.open = mockOpen;
});
```

### ✅ 1. Mock Analysis - Appropriate Mocking

Mocks are appropriate for infrastructure:
- `next/navigation` router - necessary for testing navigation
- `react-console-emulator` - third-party UI library mock allows testing command behavior
- `window.open` - browser API that can't be tested without mocking

These are **infrastructure mocks**, not business logic mocks.

### ✅ 15. Test Quality - Good User-Focused Tests

The tests focus on user-visible behavior:
- Commands execute correctly
- Navigation works as expected
- Display shows correct information
- GitHub link opens correctly

This follows the guideline of testing user behavior, not implementation details.

### ⚠️ 15. Console Output Mocking Without Strong Assertions

**Location**: `turbo/apps/web/app/components/__tests__/TerminalHome.test.tsx:126-143`

The test mocks console.log and checks output:
```typescript
const consoleSpy = vi.spyOn(console, "log");
aboutCommand.click();
expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining("uSpark - The Manager for ALL AI Coding Tools"),
);
```

This is **acceptable** because:
- The terminal library outputs to console.log in the mock
- Assertions verify the actual content
- This tests the command return value indirectly

However, this is testing implementation details (console output) rather than user-visible behavior (terminal display).

## Positive Aspects

1. **Good Test Coverage**: 8 comprehensive tests added (306 total, up from 298)

2. **Type Safety**: All tests properly typed

3. **Mock Cleanup**: Proper `vi.clearAllMocks()` usage

4. **User-Focused Testing**: Tests verify command behavior from user perspective

5. **Infrastructure Mocking Only**: Doesn't mock business logic

6. **Removes Conflicting Code**: Cleans up custom help command that conflicted with library

## Recommendations

### Low Priority

1. **Consider Testing Terminal Display Instead of Console**: The console.log assertions in the "about command" test could be improved by testing what the user sees in the terminal rather than console output.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

Good test coverage with appropriate infrastructure mocking. Tests focus on user behavior. The console.log assertions are a minor issue but acceptable given the terminal library's behavior.
