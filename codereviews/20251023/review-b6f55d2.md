**Title:** fix(cli): remove --continue flag from claude-worker execution
**PR:** #725

## Summary
Removes the `--continue` flag from claude-worker command execution, ensuring each worker iteration starts with a fresh Claude conversation instead of continuing from previous iterations. This prevents context accumulation across iterations.

## Changes
- `turbo/apps/cli/src/commands/claude-worker.ts` - Removed `--continue` flag from spawn arguments
- `turbo/apps/cli/src/commands/claude-worker.test.ts` - Updated test expectations to match
