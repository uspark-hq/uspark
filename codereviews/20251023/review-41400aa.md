**Commit:** 41400aaf1077c5b51da39020dd3131ffff1576aa
**Title:** fix(workspace): improve workers count display format
**PR:** #726

## Summary
UI improvement to the workers count display in the project details page header. Changes from badge-based display to inline text format with proper singular/plural handling.

## Changes
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/project/workers-popover.tsx` - Modified WorkersPopover component

## Code Review Findings

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ No issues found - No mocking introduced or modified

### 2. Test Coverage
⚠️ **Issue Found**: No tests added for the new display format
- The PR test plan includes manual test scenarios but no automated tests
- Should have tests verifying singular/plural grammar ("1 worker" vs "N workers")
- Should test the display with 0, 1, and multiple workers

### 3. Error Handling
✅ No issues found - Simple UI change with no error handling needed

### 4. Interface Changes
✅ No issues found - Component maintains same public interface

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ No issues found - No timers or delays present

### 6. Dynamic Imports
✅ No issues found - Only uses static imports

### 7. Database/Service Mocking
✅ No issues found - No database operations involved

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ No issues found - No test file modifications

### 9. TypeScript `any` Usage
✅ No issues found - No use of `any` type

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
✅ No issues found - No test modifications

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues found - No URLs present

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
✅ No issues found - No test modifications

### 13. Fallback Patterns
✅ No issues found - No fallback logic introduced

### 14. Lint/Type Suppressions
✅ No issues found - No suppression comments added

### 15. Bad Tests
✅ No issues found - No tests added (which is itself an issue noted in #2)

## Overall Assessment
**Quality Rating:** Good (minor test coverage gap)

This is a clean UI improvement with proper singular/plural grammar handling. The code change is simple and straightforward. However, it lacks automated test coverage for the new display format.

## Recommendations
1. **Add component tests** to verify the display format:
   - Test with `activeCount = 0` shows "0 workers"
   - Test with `activeCount = 1` shows "1 worker" (singular)
   - Test with `activeCount = 5` shows "5 workers" (plural)
2. Consider extracting the pluralization logic into a utility function if this pattern is used elsewhere
