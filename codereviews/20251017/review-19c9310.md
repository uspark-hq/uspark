**Commit:** feat: add agent skills system with progressive disclosure (#560)
**Author:** Ethan Zhang
**Date:** 2025-10-17 16:19:37 -0700

## Summary

This commit introduces the Agent Skills system - a new framework for providing composable, progressively-loaded knowledge resources for Claude. The system includes two initial skills: Conventional Commits and Project Principles.

## Changes

## Code Review Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Excellent Use of Progressive Disclosure**
   - Metadata loaded at startup (name + description)
   - SKILL.md loaded when skill is relevant
   - Detailed files loaded only when needed
   - Optimizes context window usage effectively

2. **Well-Structured Documentation**
   - Clear hierarchy: README ‚Üí SKILL.md ‚Üí detailed files
   - Consistent formatting across all skills
   - Good use of frontmatter for metadata
   - Comprehensive examples and guidelines

3. **Follows YAGNI Principle**
   - Only two skills added initially (conventional-commits, project-principles)
   - These are immediately useful and actively needed
   - No speculative skills added "just in case"
   - Room to grow as needed

4. **Documentation-Only Change**
   - No functional code changes
   - Low risk
   - Pure knowledge/reference material

5. **Good Testing**
   - Format, lint, and tests all passed
   - Proper acknowledgment of pre-existing TypeScript errors

### üîç Code Smell Check

#### ‚ùå New Mocks
- **Status:** N/A (documentation only)

#### ‚ùå Test Coverage
- **Status:** N/A (documentation only)

#### ‚ùå Unnecessary Try/Catch
- **Status:** N/A (documentation only)

#### ‚ùå Over-Engineering
- **Status:** ‚úÖ GOOD
- The progressive disclosure approach prevents over-engineering
- Could have been tempted to add many more skills upfront, but wisely started with just 2
- System is designed to scale without bloating

#### ‚ùå Timer/Delay Usage
- **Status:** N/A (documentation only)

### üìù Architecture Notes

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern:**
```
Startup:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Load metadata (lightweight)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Know what's available

Task starts:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Load SKILL.md (moderate)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Get quick reference

Need details:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Load specific files (heavy)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Get comprehensive info
```

This is an elegant solution to the context window challenge.

**Skills Included:**
1. **Conventional Commits** - Essential for maintaining consistent git history and automated releases
2. **Project Principles** - Core coding standards (YAGNI, no defensive programming, type safety, zero lint)

Both skills address real, immediate needs and provide significant value.

### üí° Observations

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidates project guidelines that were previously scattered
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new skills without modifying core instructions
3. **Maintenance**: Each skill can be updated independently
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with sub-agents and workflows
5. **Inspired by Anthropic**: Based on [Anthropic's Agent Skills article](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Concerns

1. **Duplication Risk**: Need to ensure guidelines don't drift between CLAUDE.md and skills (addressed in commit 852dc59)
2. **Discoverability**: Relies on Claude knowing when to load skills - requires good metadata descriptions
3. **Documentation Size**: 3,595 lines is substantial - important to verify all content is necessary

However, these concerns are minor given the benefits of the system.

## Verdict

‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Excellent architectural addition that solves real problems with an elegant progressive disclosure pattern. No code smells detected. The implementation follows the project's own YAGNI principle by starting small with just two essential skills.

**Highlights:**
- Clean, well-structured documentation
- Solves context window optimization problem
- Follows project principles (especially YAGNI)
- Documentation-only, low-risk change
- Provides immediate value
