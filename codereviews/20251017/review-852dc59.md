**Date:** 2025-10-17 16:36:05 -0700

## Summary

This commit removes redundant documentation following the introduction of the Agent Skills system. It deletes `.claude/skills/README.md` and removes duplicate sections from `CLAUDE.md` that are now maintained in Agent Skills.

## Changes

- Deleted `.claude/skills/README.md` (216 lines)
- Removed "Architecture Design Principles" section from `CLAUDE.md` (moved to `project-principles` skill)
- Removed "Commit Message Guidelines" section from `CLAUDE.md` (moved to `conventional-commits` skill)
- Total: 373 lines deleted

## Code Review Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Follows YAGNI Principle**
   - Removes documentation that duplicates the Agent Skills system
   - Keeps CLAUDE.md focused on operational guidelines
   - Eliminates unnecessary README that doesn't add value

2. **Clear Documentation-Only Change**
   - No functional code changes
   - Pure documentation cleanup
   - Low risk change

3. **Good Separation of Concerns**
   - Agent Skills: "how to do things" (design principles, commit guidelines)
   - CLAUDE.md: "how to run things" (services, dev setup, CI checks)

4. **Proper Testing**
   - Verified no functional code changes
   - Confirmed Agent Skills still work (auto-discovery unchanged)
   - Checked CLAUDE.md retains essential operational guidelines

### üìù Notes

This is a clean documentation refactoring that follows the project's own principles:
- **YAGNI**: Removes documentation that isn't needed anymore
- **Single Source of Truth**: Design principles and commit guidelines now live only in Agent Skills
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Agent Skills are loaded when relevant, reducing cognitive overhead

The change makes sense given the introduction of the Agent Skills system in PR #560.

## Verdict

‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Clean documentation refactoring with no code smells detected.
