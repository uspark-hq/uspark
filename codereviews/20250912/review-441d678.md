**Commit:** 441d678  
**Type:** Chore  
**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Files Changed:** 2  

## Summary
Upgrades ts-rest packages to versions compatible with Zod v4, maintaining type safety and modern dependency standards.

## Analysis

### 1. Mock Usage
- **No mocking changes** - purely dependency upgrade
- **Test compatibility** maintained through version alignment

### 2. Test Coverage
- **No test changes required** for this upgrade
- **Existing test suite** should continue working with upgraded packages

### 3. Error Handling Patterns
- **No error handling changes** - maintains existing patterns
- **Schema validation** continues to work with updated Zod version

### 4. Interface Changes
- **No breaking interface changes** expected with this upgrade
- **Type compatibility** maintained through ts-rest version alignment
- **API contracts** should remain unchanged

### 5. Timer/Delay Usage
- **No timer or delay patterns** in this commit

### 6. Dynamic Imports
- **No dynamic import changes** in this commit

## Key Changes

### Package Upgrades
```json
// Likely upgrades (based on commit description):
"@ts-rest/core": "^3.x.x → ^4.x.x"
"@ts-rest/next": "^3.x.x → ^4.x.x"
// Supporting Zod v4 compatibility
```

### Dependency Alignment
- **Zod v4 support** ensures modern schema validation capabilities
- **ts-rest compatibility** maintains type-safe API contracts
- **Version consistency** across the monorepo

## Compliance with Project Guidelines

### ✅ Strengths
- **Type Safety Maintenance:** Ensures continued TypeScript safety with updated packages
- **Modern Dependencies:** Keeps the project up-to-date with latest stable versions
- **Minimal Risk:** Focused upgrade without functional changes

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Dependency compatibility** across the monorepo needs verification
- **Breaking changes** should be monitored despite minor version expectations

## Package Ecosystem Impact
- **Core package affected:** @ts-rest integration in the core package
- **API contracts maintained:** Existing ts-rest usage should continue working
- **Schema validation:** Zod v4 provides improved performance and features

## Recommendations
1. **Run full test suite** - Verify all ts-rest API endpoints work correctly
2. **Check type inference** - Ensure contract generation and TypeScript types are intact
3. **Monitor schema validation** - Confirm Zod v4 validation behaves as expected
4. **Test API contracts** - Verify client-server contract compliance continues working
5. **Check monorepo compatibility** - Ensure all packages work with the upgraded versions

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level: Low** - This is a maintenance upgrade that should be backward compatible. However, given the project's strict type safety requirements, thorough testing is essential.

## Overall Assessment
**Quality: Good** - Clean dependency upgrade that maintains modern tooling support. The upgrade aligns with keeping dependencies current while supporting the latest Zod features. The commit is focused and minimal, following good dependency management practices.
