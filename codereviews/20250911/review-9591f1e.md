# Code Review: 9591f1e - refactor: change workspace app routing to use root path

## Summary of Changes

Refactored the workspace app routing from `/workspace` to `/` (root path) to align with dedicated domain setup. Updated all references, tests, and navigation links consistently across the codebase.

**Files Changed:**
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/signals/bootstrap.ts` - Route configuration
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/types/route.ts` - Type definition
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/project/project-page.tsx` - Navigation link
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/project/__tests__/project-page.test.tsx` - Test assertion
- `turbo/apps/workspace/src/views/workspace/__tests__/workspace.test.tsx` - Test setup

## Mock Analysis

✅ **No new mocks introduced**
- Changes only modify route paths and test expectations
- No new mock objects or artificial testing constructs added

## Test Coverage Quality

✅ **Excellent test coverage maintenance**
- All affected tests properly updated to match new routing
- Tests verify navigation behavior works with new paths
- No test coverage gaps introduced

## Error Handling Review

✅ **No unnecessary error handling**
- Routing changes are declarative configuration
- No defensive try/catch blocks added
- Clean error-free refactoring

## Interface Changes

✅ **Well-managed interface changes**
- `RoutePath` type properly updated to reflect new route structure
- All consuming code updated consistently
- No breaking changes for external consumers

## Timer/Delay Analysis

✅ **No timers or artificial delays**
- Pure routing configuration changes
- No asynchronous operations or timing logic introduced

## Recommendations

### Positive Aspects
1. **Comprehensive consistency** - All related files updated in a single commit
2. **Type safety maintained** - Route type definition properly updated
3. **Test coverage preserved** - All tests updated to match new behavior
4. **Clear rationale** - Commit message explains alignment with dedicated domain setup
5. **Atomic change** - Single logical change completed in one commit

### Areas for Consideration
1. **Documentation updates** - Consider if any README or documentation needs route updates
2. **Deployment coordination** - Ensure domain routing configuration matches this change

### Technical Quality
- **Route configuration is clean and declarative**
- **Type definitions properly maintained**
- **Test assertions correctly updated**
- **Navigation logic remains consistent**

### Overall Assessment
**EXCELLENT** - This is a textbook example of a well-executed refactoring. All affected code and tests were updated consistently, maintaining type safety and test coverage throughout.

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW
**Complexity:** SIMPLE
**YAGNI Compliance:** PERFECT - Changes only what's needed for the routing update
