# Code Review: 096207b - chore: set workspace app initial version to 0.0.1

## Summary of Changes

Simple version bump from 1.0.0 to 0.0.1 in the workspace app's package.json. This aligns the workspace app with proper semantic versioning practices by starting from the beginning.

**Files Changed:**
- `turbo/apps/workspace/package.json` - Version field updated

## Mock Analysis

✅ **No new mocks introduced**
- This is a simple configuration change
- No testing logic or mock objects added

## Test Coverage Quality

✅ **Not applicable** 
- Version number change does not require additional test coverage
- Existing tests continue to work without modification

## Error Handling Review

✅ **No error handling concerns**
- Simple configuration change with no runtime implications
- No unnecessary try/catch blocks added

## Interface Changes

✅ **No breaking interface changes**
- Version number is metadata only
- No API or component interface modifications

## Timer/Delay Analysis

✅ **No timers or artificial delays**
- Pure configuration change
- No asynchronous operations introduced

## Recommendations

### Positive Aspects
1. **Follows semantic versioning best practices** - Starting from 0.0.1 indicates pre-release status
2. **Clear commit message** - Follows conventional commit format with proper scope
3. **Minimal change scope** - Single file, single line change reduces risk
4. **Good documentation** - Commit message explains the rationale clearly

### Areas for Consideration
1. **Version strategy alignment** - Ensure this aligns with the overall versioning strategy across the monorepo
2. **Release coordination** - Consider if other packages need similar version resets

### Overall Assessment
**EXCELLENT** - This is a perfect example of a focused, well-documented configuration change that follows project guidelines. The change is minimal, clear, and properly justified.

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW
**Complexity:** TRIVIAL
**YAGNI Compliance:** PERFECT - Only changes what's immediately needed
