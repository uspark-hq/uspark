4. **Success Metrics** - Add quantifiable completion criteria

### Future Considerations
1. **Planning Cadence** - Establish regular planning document schedule
2. **Progress Tracking** - Link to project management tools
3. **Historical Analysis** - Track actual vs planned completion rates
4. **Documentation Maintenance** - Update plans as priorities change

## Overall Assessment

**Score: 7/10** - Good planning content with critical date issue

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Planning** - Covers all aspects of development cycle

2. Merge after date issue is resolved
3. Use as template for future planning documents

**Key Benefits After Fix:**
1. ✅ Excellent project planning methodology
2. ✅ Clear task prioritization and dependencies  
3. ✅ Comprehensive scope covering development to deployment
4. ✅ Good integration testing strategy
5. ✅ Realistic and achievable daily goals
