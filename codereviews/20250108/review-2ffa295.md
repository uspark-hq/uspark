**Title:** refactor: replace manual database operations with api handlers in tests (#207)  
**Date:** Mon Sep 8 15:46:09 2025 +0800

## Summary
Major test refactoring that replaces 80+ manual database operations with API handler calls across 10 test files. Addresses technical debt by making tests use production code paths instead of bypassing business logic through direct database manipulation.

## Files Changed
- `spec/tech-debt.md` (2 items marked completed)
- 10 test files across the API routes (566 additions, 418 deletions)

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
**Status:** ⚠️ Minor Considerations  
**Issues Found:**
- Tests now depend on API endpoints working correctly, which could mask issues in the API handlers themselves
- Some tests still use direct database operations for setup scenarios that don't have API equivalents:
  ```typescript
  // Still needed for edge cases like different user ownership
  await globalThis.services.db.insert(PROJECTS_TBL).values({
    id: projectId,
    userId: "other-user", // Different from authenticated user
    ydocData: base64Data,
    version: 0,
  });
  ```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Acceptable**  
The remaining direct database operations are justified for testing edge cases and error conditions that cannot be easily created through API endpoints.

### 2. Test Coverage
**Status:** ✅ Significantly Improved  
**Major Improvements:**
1. **Production Code Path Testing** - Tests now exercise the actual API handlers
2. **Better Integration Testing** - Tests validate entire request/response cycles
3. **Maintained Test Count** - All 43 test files still passing
4. **Error Scenario Coverage** - Proper testing of API error responses

**Example of Improvement:**
```typescript
// Before: Direct database manipulation (bypasses business logic)
await globalThis.services.db.insert(PROJECTS_TBL).values({
  id: projectId,
  userId,
  ydocData: base64Data,
  version: 0,
});

// After: Using API handler (tests production code path)
const createRequest = new NextRequest("http://localhost:3000", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: "test-project" }),
});
const createResponse = await createProject(createRequest);
const createdProject = await createResponse.json();
```

### 3. Error Handling
**Status:** ✅ Excellent  
No defensive programming anti-patterns introduced. The refactoring maintains proper error propagation:
- API handlers naturally throw/return error responses
- Tests properly assert on error conditions  
- No unnecessary try/catch wrapping

### 4. Interface Changes
**Status:** ✅ No Breaking Changes  
- Test interfaces remain the same
- Public API routes unchanged
- Internal test utilities improved but compatible

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
**Status:** ⚠️ Minor Considerations  
**Found Artificial Delays:**
```typescript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Acceptable**  
These small delays are used to ensure proper ordering in test scenarios where database timestamps matter. This is a reasonable testing practice for time-sensitive operations.

### 6. Code Quality
**Status:** ✅ Excellent Improvement  

**Major Quality Improvements:**

1. **Reduced Coupling** - Tests less dependent on database schema
2. **Better Maintainability** - API changes automatically reflected in tests
3. **Realistic Test Scenarios** - Tests use actual request/response patterns
4. **Consistent Patterns** - Standardized approach across all test files

**Example of Quality Improvement:**
```typescript
// Before: Complex direct database setup
const ydoc = new Y.Doc();
const files = ydoc.getMap("files");  
files.set("test.md", { hash: "abc123", mtime: Date.now() });
const state = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc);
const base64Data = Buffer.from(state).toString("base64");
await globalThis.services.db.insert(PROJECTS_TBL).values({
  id: projectId,
  userId,
  ydocData: base64Data,
  version: 3,
});

// After: Simple API call
const createRequest = new NextRequest("http://localhost:3000", {
  method: "POST", 
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: "test-project" }),
});
const createResponse = await createProject(createRequest);
```

2. **Import Organization** - Clean separation of test utilities and API handlers
3. **Variable Naming** - Consistent naming conventions maintained
4. **Error Scenarios** - Better testing of edge cases through API responses

### 7. Security Considerations
**Status:** ✅ Enhanced Security Testing  
**Improvements:**
- Tests now validate authentication through API handlers
- Authorization logic tested as part of API requests
- Better simulation of real-world attack vectors
- Proper testing of user isolation (different user access scenarios)

## Architectural Impact

### Major Benefits Achieved

1. **YAGNI Compliance** ✅
   - Removed complex database setup utilities that were only used in tests
   - Eliminated duplicate business logic in test setup
   - Tests now reuse production code paths

2. **Better Integration Testing** ✅  
   - Tests validate complete request processing pipelines
   - Authentication and authorization tested naturally
   - Database transactions and error handling tested as integrated units

3. **Reduced Technical Debt** ✅
   - Marked 2 tech debt items as completed in `spec/tech-debt.md`
   - Eliminated 80+ manual database operations
   - Reduced maintenance burden for schema changes

4. **Improved Test Reliability** ✅
   - Tests fail when business logic changes (good!)
   - Less brittle to database schema modifications
   - More realistic test scenarios

### Potential Risks Mitigated

1. **API Handler Bugs** - Tests that use API handlers will catch issues in those handlers
2. **Test Maintenance** - Easier to maintain when API logic changes
3. **Business Logic Validation** - Tests now validate complete business workflows

## Test Architecture Analysis

### Before Refactoring
```
Test → Direct Database Operations → Database
```
**Problems:**
- Bypassed authentication/authorization
- Skipped validation logic
- Brittle to schema changes
- Duplicated business logic

### After Refactoring  
```
Test → API Handler → Business Logic → Database
```
**Benefits:**
- Tests complete business workflows
- Validates authentication/authorization
- Resilient to implementation changes
- Reuses production code paths

## Technical Debt Resolution

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ "Replace manual database operations in tests with API handlers"
- ✅ "Refactor tests to reuse existing API endpoints for data setup"

**Impact on Codebase Health:**
- Reduced code duplication between tests and production
- Improved maintainability of test suite
- Better alignment with project architecture principles
- Enhanced confidence in business logic validation

## Performance Considerations

### Test Performance Impact
- **Positive:** Reduced test setup complexity
- **Neutral:** API handler calls vs direct database - minimal performance difference
- **Positive:** Less complex transaction management in tests

### Production Confidence

2. ✅ **Tech Debt Updated** - Documentation properly updated
3. ✅ **Coverage Maintained** - No reduction in test coverage

### Future Considerations

1. **API Test Utilities** - Consider creating shared utilities for common API testing patterns:
   ```typescript
   // Future utility function
   async function createTestProject(name: string) {
     const request = new NextRequest("http://localhost:3000", {
       method: "POST",
       body: JSON.stringify({ name }),
     });
     const response = await createProject(request);
     return response.json();
   }
   ```

2. **Test Data Factories** - Implement factory patterns for complex test data creation
3. **Snapshot Testing** - Consider adding snapshot tests for API response structures
4. **Performance Testing** - Add performance benchmarks for critical API endpoints
