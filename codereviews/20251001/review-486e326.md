## Bad Smell Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No new mocks added
- Uses real database for testing (good practice)

### 2. Test Coverage
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Excellent test coverage: 5 comprehensive test cases
- Tests authentication, authorization, not found scenarios
- Tests cascade deletion of all related data
- Tests deletion without related data
- All 482 tests passing

### 3. Error Handling
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Appropriate try/catch in UI for error state display
- API uses fail-fast approach (no try/catch, lets errors propagate)
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 404, 204)

### 4. Interface Changes
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- New DELETE endpoint added with clear contract
- Returns 204 No Content on success (standard REST practice)
- Proper authentication and authorization checks

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No timers or delays

### 6. Dynamic Import Analysis
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No dynamic imports

### 7. Database and Service Mocking
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Uses real database in tests (good!)
- No mocking of globalThis.services
- Tests verify actual database state before and after deletion

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Test file includes vi.clearAllMocks() in beforeEach

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No `any` types used

### 10. Artificial Delays in Tests
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No artificial delays in tests

### 11. Hardcoded URLs and Configuration
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No hardcoded URLs in implementation
- Test URLs are mock URLs (acceptable)

### 12. Direct Database Operations in Tests
**Status:** ⚠️ OBSERVATION
- Tests use direct DB operations to create test data
- **Note:** This is acceptable for setup/teardown in API tests
- Tests verify deletion through database queries (appropriate for DB operation testing)
- For project creation, uses API endpoint POST (good!)

### 13. Avoid Fallback Patterns
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No fallback patterns
- Fails fast when project not found or unauthorized

### 14. Prohibition of Lint/Type Suppressions
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- No suppressions
- All lint and type checks passing

### 15. Avoid Bad Tests
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Tests verify real behavior, not mocks
- No fake tests
- No testing of trivial UI states
- Tests focus on meaningful deletion logic and data integrity
- Good use of API endpoint for project creation in tests

## Overall Assessment
**Rating:** ✅ GOOD

Excellent implementation of project deletion feature with comprehensive testing. The code:
- Properly handles cascade deletion in correct order (respects foreign key constraints)
- Includes robust authorization checks
- Has comprehensive test coverage (5 test cases covering all scenarios)
- Uses real database in tests for high confidence
- Follows REST conventions (204 No Content)
- No bad code smells detected

## Recommendations
None. This is a well-implemented feature with excellent test coverage.

## Notes
- The commit message notes that GitHub repos and Blob files are intentionally NOT deleted (only database links removed)
- Cascade deletion order is correct: sessions → github repos → share links → agent sessions → project
- The later commit (63ae663) removes the delete confirmation dialog, making deletion immediate
