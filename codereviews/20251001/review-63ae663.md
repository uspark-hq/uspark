## Overall Assessment
**Rating:** ✅ GOOD

This is a clean refactoring commit that simplifies the UI by removing the delete confirmation dialog. The change:
- Removes 3 state variables (`showDeleteDialog`, `projectToDelete`, `deleting`)
- Removes 49 lines of dialog UI code
- Simplifies the delete handler to accept project parameter directly
- Maintains proper error handling
- No bad code smells detected

## Recommendations
None. This is a well-executed simplification that follows all project guidelines.

## Notes
The removal of delete confirmation is a UX decision (not a code quality issue). Users should be aware that projects are now deleted immediately without confirmation.
