# Code Review: PR #162 - Remove Unused Files (21fabba)

## Summary
✅ **APPROVED** - Excellent YAGNI principle implementation through cleanup

## Changes Reviewed
Removed 289 lines across 6 unused files identified by knip analysis:
- Test utilities and database setup files
- Blob storage implementations
- Clerk authentication mocks

## Review Criteria

### 1. Mock Analysis
**✅ Excellent** - Removed unused mocks:
- `apps/web/src/test/mocks/clerk.ts` (69 lines) - Clerk auth mocks that were completely unused
- This aligns perfectly with the "avoid premature abstractions" principle

### 2. Test Coverage
**✅ Good** - Removed unused test infrastructure:
- `apps/web/src/test/per-test-db-setup.ts` (162 lines) - Complex per-test database isolation that wasn't being used
- `apps/cli/src/test/utils.ts` (43 lines) - Test utilities including MSW helpers that weren't needed
- These were over-engineered solutions that violated YAGNI

### 3. Error Handling  
**N/A** - File deletions only

### 4. Interface Changes
**✅ Safe** - No public interface changes:
- `apps/web/src/db/index.ts` - Was only re-exporting types
- `apps/web/src/lib/blob/index.ts` and `storage.ts` - Unused blob storage abstractions

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
**N/A** - No timer-related code

## Key Findings

**Excellent YAGNI Implementation:**
- Removed 162 lines of complex per-test database isolation that was never used
- Deleted premature abstractions for blob storage that weren't needed
- Cleaned up test utilities that violated the "don't add functionality until needed" principle

**Perfect Adherence to Project Principles:**
- This is exactly what YAGNI advocates - removing code that "might be useful someday"
- The per-test database setup was particularly over-engineered with connection pooling, migration support, and cleanup logic

## Recommendations
None - this is exemplary cleanup work that should be a model for future technical debt reduction.

## Verdict
✅ **APPROVED** - Outstanding application of YAGNI principle
