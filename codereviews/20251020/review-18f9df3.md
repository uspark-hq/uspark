# Review: fix(cli): move file sync from watch-claude to exec script

**Commit:** 18f9df3dbb1c318d6895003420006d4b34bbb4f6
**PR:** #656

## Summary
Moves file synchronization from real-time (during watch-claude) to batch mode (after Claude execution) to prevent concurrent update conflicts. Adds --prefix option to uspark pull for filtering files by path prefix.

## Code Smell Analysis

### 1. Mock Analysis
✅ No issues - No mocks

### 2. Test Coverage
✅ **Good** - Watch-claude tests updated to reflect new behavior (no sync)

### 3. Error Handling
✅ No issues - No error handling changes

### 4. Interface Changes
✅ **Breaking change documented** - watch-claude no longer performs sync, callers must call `uspark push --all` after execution

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
✅ No issues - No timers

### 6. Dynamic Imports
✅ No issues - No dynamic imports

### 7. Database Mocking
✅ No issues - No database mocking

### 8. Test Mock Cleanup
✅ No issues - Tests properly updated

### 9. TypeScript any Usage
✅ No issues - No `any` types

### 10. Artificial Delays
✅ No issues - No delays

### 11. Hardcoded URLs
✅ No issues - No URLs

### 12. Direct DB Operations
✅ No issues - No database operations

### 13. Fallback Patterns
✅ No issues - No fallback logic

### 14. Lint Suppressions

### 15. Bad Tests
✅ No issues - Tests appropriately reduced (116 lines removed) since sync logic was removed

## Overall Assessment
**APPROVED**

## Recommendations
None - Good fix for race condition. Moving from real-time to batch sync prevents 409 conflicts when multiple files are written rapidly.
