# Review: test: fix blob url mocks to include project path prefix

## Commit: 34df981

## Summary
This commit fixes test mocks to align with the correct blob URL format that includes the project path prefix. The change updates test mocks from the old format `/{hash}` to the new format `/projects/:projectId/{hash}` using wildcard patterns for flexible project ID handling.

## Findings

### Good Practices
- **Minimal, focused change**: Only modified what was necessary to fix the failing tests
- **Clear commit message**: Follows conventional commit format and explains the fix
- **Proper test maintenance**: Updated mocks to align with production URL format
- **Flexible wildcard pattern**: Used `:projectId` to handle different project IDs in tests
- **Preserved existing functionality**: No changes to test coverage or behavior

### Issues Found
**None significant** - This is a well-executed test maintenance fix.

**Minor observations:**
- The change is reactive rather than proactive - tests broke after PR #363 and this fixes them
- Could consider adding test coverage to ensure URL format consistency in the future

## Recommendations

1. **Consider URL format validation**: Add a test utility or constant to ensure URL format consistency across tests and production code

2. **Documentation**: The inline comment explaining "wildcard for any project ID" is helpful and should be maintained

3. **Pattern consistency**: Consider establishing a pattern for how blob URL mocks should be structured to prevent similar issues in the future

**Overall Assessment**: âœ… **Good** - This is a clean, focused fix that addresses the immediate issue without introducing complexity or over-engineering.
