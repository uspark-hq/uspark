# Development Retrospectives

## Session 1: File Explorer Component Implementation (PR #107)

### Project Overview
**Task**: Implement file browser component with YJS integration (Task #4)  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully merged with 45 comprehensive tests

### Key Learnings

#### Architecture Understanding - "Don't Assume, Ask First"
**User Correction**: *"服务端不会提供你要的获取文件/文件夹的接口了。服务端只会提供现在的 yjs snapshot 接口。你需要在前端解析出整个文件系统结构"*

**Learning**: Always understand existing system architecture before proposing solutions. The project uses YJS snapshots, not traditional REST endpoints.

#### Proper Dependencies - "Use Real Tools in Development"
**User Correction**: *"cd turbo pnpm install 一下？这不应该 mock"*

**Learning**: Don't over-mock core dependencies. Install and use real libraries when they're central to functionality.

#### Project Conventions - "Follow Standards"
**User Correction**: *"这个页面应该叫 /projects/:id 吧"*

**Learning**: Follow established naming patterns and URL structures rather than creating separate demo implementations.

#### Testing Culture - "Tests Are Not Optional"
**User Question**: *"有测试吗"*

**Learning**: Testing should be part of initial development plan. The user values comprehensive test coverage.

### Technical Achievements
- YJS Integration: Parse Y.Map structures to build file system trees
- Component Architecture: Separate concerns (parser, UI, integration)
- Testing Strategy: Unit → Integration → Page-level tests (45 tests total)
- Error Boundaries: Graceful handling of async operations

## Session 2: Public Document Share Page (PR #106)

### Project Overview
**Task**: Implement public document share viewer (Task #7)  
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully merged with hash-based API integration

### Key Learnings

#### MVP Discipline - "简单搞"
**User Direction**: *"文档查看器尽可能简单搞，先不要做语法高亮什么的"*

**Learning**: Start simple. Avoid premature optimization. The user consistently pulled back from over-engineering.

#### Architecture Alignment - "Check Dependencies"
**User Guidance**: *"看一下 PR #99 中的接口，对你是否有影响"*

**Learning**: Always check for related PRs and understand how your work fits into the system evolution (PR #99, #101, #112).

#### Scope Management - "MVP Only"
**User Clarification**: *"mvp 只有分享单个文件的方案"*

**Learning**: Focus on current requirements. Single-file sharing only, not multi-file or project sharing.

#### Stay Current - "Merge Main First"
**User Instruction**: *"合并下 origin/main 吧，然后继续干活"*

**Learning**: Regularly sync with main branch to avoid conflicts and stay aligned with latest changes.

### Technical Implementation
- Hash-based API: Updated from content delivery to `{ hash, mtime }` pattern
- Blob Storage Ready: Prepared for Vercel Blob integration
- Graceful Fallback: Handle unavailable storage without breaking UX
- Mobile Responsive: Full breakpoint coverage

## Core Development Philosophy

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Consistently choose simpler solutions
- Avoid premature abstractions
- Focus on what's actually needed now
- "简单搞" is the mantra

### Architecture Consistency
- Strong emphasis on aligning with existing patterns
- Understand system-wide changes before implementing
- Check recent PRs for related work
- Prefer extending existing systems over building new ones

### Quality Without Compromise
- Zero tolerance for failing checks
- Proper commit message formatting is required
- Code formatting is non-negotiable
- All lint/type checks must pass before merge

### Communication Patterns
- **Direct & Efficient**: "对的，简化下" - minimal words, maximum clarity
- **Context-Heavy**: Always provide PR numbers and architectural background
- **Outcome-Focused**: Clear success criteria and definitions of done
- **Quality-First**: Proactively asks about testing and monitors pipeline status

## Recommended Development Process

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Check recent PRs for related work
- [ ] Understand current architecture patterns
- [ ] Confirm MVP scope and constraints
- [ ] Verify API contracts and dependencies
- [ ] Review existing codebase thoroughly

### Development Workflow
1. **Start Simple**: Basic implementation first
2. **Get Feedback**: User validates approach
3. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback
4. **Test**: Comprehensive coverage required
5. **Quality Check**: Lint, types, formatting
6. **Ship**: Clean, focused implementation

### Quality Gates
- All pipeline checks must pass
- Proper conventional commits
- Code formatting applied
- TypeScript type safety
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

## Key Takeaways

### What Works Well
- **Architecture-First Thinking**: Understanding before building
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple feedback rounds lead to robust results
- **MVP Discipline**: Prevents feature creep and over-engineering
- **Quality Gates**: Maintains high code standards consistently

### Areas for Continuous Improvement
- **Initial Requirements Gathering**: Ask about existing related PRs upfront
- **Cross-PR Awareness**: Proactively check for related work in progress
- **Testing Strategy**: Include in initial planning, not as afterthought
- **Incremental Validation**: Check architectural decisions early

### Success Metrics Across Sessions
- ✅ 45+ comprehensive tests (File Explorer)
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ All lint checks passing
- ✅ Successful PR merges (#106, #107)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable architecture
- ✅ Aligned with project philosophy

## Final Thoughts

Great development happens when there's:
- Clear communication
- Strong architectural awareness  
- Disciplined scope management
- Uncompromising quality standards

The user's approach of **"check existing work → simplify → build → quality check → ship"** is a model worth following consistently.
