**Recommendation**:
[Specific, actionable solution]

**Code Example**:
```tsx
// Suggested implementation
```
```

**Reference**:
[Design principle, WCAG guideline, or best practice citation]

**Effort**: [Small (< 1h) | Medium (1-4h) | Large (> 4h)]
```

### Step 4: Generate Report

## Issue Severity Guidelines

**Critical**: Blocks core functionality, severe accessibility violations, breaks user flows
- Authentication failures
- Form submission failures
- Critical accessibility violations (e.g., completely unusable with screen reader)
- Data loss scenarios

**High**: Significantly impacts UX, major accessibility issues, inconsistent branding
- Poor contrast making text hard to read
- Missing loading states causing confusion
- Broken responsive layouts
- Inconsistent navigation patterns

**Medium**: Noticeable but non-blocking issues, minor accessibility gaps, polish needed
- Suboptimal spacing or alignment
- Missing hover states
- Inconsistent button styles
- Minor accessibility improvements

**Low**: Refinements, subtle improvements, edge cases
- Color palette optimization
- Micro-interaction enhancements
- Typography fine-tuning
- Code refactoring for maintainability

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
‚ùå "The layout needs improvement"
‚úÖ "The card grid lacks consistent spacing. Current gap is inconsistent (24px on desktop, 16px on mobile). Recommend using Tailwind's gap-6 for consistent 24px spacing across breakpoints."

### Reference Standards
‚ùå "Add better labels"
‚úÖ "Form inputs lack associated labels (WCAG 3.3.2). Add explicit <label> elements with htmlFor attributes matching input IDs."

### Provide Solutions
‚ùå "This doesn't follow the design system"
‚úÖ "Replace custom button styles with shadcn/ui Button component variant='default'. See: apps/web/components/ui/button.tsx"

### Consider Context
- Understand business requirements may override pure design ideals
- Balance perfection with pragmatism
- Consider development effort in recommendations
- Acknowledge technical constraints

### Be Constructive
- Highlight what works well, not just problems
- Frame issues as opportunities for improvement
- Provide learning moments, not just critiques
- Acknowledge good practices when found

## Common Patterns to Check

### Navigation Component
- Consistent across all pages
- Clear active state indicators
- Mobile menu implementation
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- User authentication state display

### Forms
- Label associations (htmlFor + id)
- Validation feedback (real-time or on submit)
- Error message clarity
- Success confirmation
- Loading states during submission
- Disabled state during processing

### Cards/Lists
- Empty states with calls-to-action
- Loading skeletons
- Hover affordances
- Consistent spacing
- Action button placement

### Dialogs/Modals
- Focus trapping
- Escape key to close
- Backdrop click behavior
- Clear close button
- Appropriate z-index
- Scroll locking

### Buttons
- Clear hierarchy (primary, secondary, ghost, destructive)
- Loading states
- Disabled states with visual feedback
- Icon + text combinations
- Consistent sizing

## Output Guidelines

1. **Be thorough but focused**: Cover all major issues, but don't overwhelm with minutiae
2. **Prioritize impact**: Lead with issues that most affect users
3. **Be actionable**: Every issue should have a clear solution
4. **Use file references**: Always include `file_path:line_number` for code issues
5. **Support with evidence**: Reference screenshots, standards, or best practices
6. **Consider the user**: Always frame issues in terms of user impact
7. **Be professional**: Maintain a constructive, educational tone

## When Reviewing Code

Focus on:
- Component structure and organization
- Accessibility implementation (ARIA, semantic HTML)
- Responsive design implementation
- Design token usage
- shadcn/ui component usage
- Tailwind class organization
- Performance considerations (unnecessary re-renders, large bundles)

## When Reviewing Screenshots

Focus on:
