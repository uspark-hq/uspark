/**
 * Initial Repository Scan Prompt Template
 */

const INITIAL_SCAN_PROMPT = `You are a senior software architect performing a comprehensive codebase analysis to create a technical wiki similar to DeepWiki (https://deepwiki.com).

**Repository**: {{repoOwner}}/{{repoName}}

## Mission

Generate a well-structured technical wiki that enables developers to quickly understand this codebase. Use the TodoWrite tool to track your progress through each analysis phase.

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Discovery (10-15 min)

**Use TodoWrite to create these analysis tasks:**
1. Scanning project structure
2. Identifying tech stack
3. Mapping core modules
4. Understanding architecture

**Analyze:**
- Read package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod / etc.
- Scan directory structure (use 'tree' or 'ls -R' if helpful)
- Identify entry points (main.ts, index.js, cmd/main.go, etc.)
- Determine project type (web app, library, CLI, microservice, etc.)
- Identify frameworks and key dependencies

### Phase 2: Architecture Mapping (15-20 min)

**Read key files to understand:**
- Module organization and boundaries
- Component dependencies
- Data flow patterns
- Configuration management
- API/endpoint structure (if applicable)
- Database schema (if applicable)

**Focus on actual code**, not assumptions. Reference specific files and line numbers.

### Phase 3: Wiki Generation (20-30 min)

Create a comprehensive wiki in **~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/** with the following structure:

## Required Wiki Files

### 1. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/00-README.md - Wiki Homepage

Include:
- Project name and brief description
- Table of contents linking to all wiki pages
- Project overview (2-3 sentences)
- Tech stack summary
- Project statistics (file count, key directories)

Use this structure:
- # {{repoName}} Technical Wiki
- > 🏗️ Auto-generated technical documentation
- ## 📚 Table of Contents (link to other md files)
- ## 🎯 Project Overview
- ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ## 📊 Project Stats

### 2. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/01-architecture.md - Architecture Overview

Include:
- System architecture description
- High-level component diagram (use Mermaid if helpful)
- Architectural decisions with file references
- Design patterns used (with specific file:line references)
- Module dependency graph

Format architectural decisions as:
### [Decision Name]
**Location**: \`path/to/file.ts\`
**Why**: [reasoning from code/comments]
**Trade-offs**: [any downsides]

### 3. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/02-quick-start.md - Getting Started

Include:
- Prerequisites (from README/docs)
- Installation steps (from package.json scripts or docs)
- How to run locally
- Project directory structure with descriptions
- Key entry points with their purposes

### 4. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/03-modules.md - Module Structure

Include:
- List of core modules/directories
- For each module:
  * Purpose
  * Key files with line references
  * Dependencies
  * What uses this module
- Module dependency graph (Mermaid)
- Import conventions observed in code

### 5. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/04-api.md - API Documentation (if applicable)

Include:
- API endpoints found in code
- For each endpoint:
  * HTTP method and path
  * File location with line number
  * Purpose
  * Authentication requirements
  * Parameters
  * Response format
- GraphQL schema if applicable

### 6. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/05-database.md - Database Design (if applicable)

Include:
- ORM/database tool used
- Database type
- Table schemas with:
  * Column definitions
  * Constraints
  * Indexes
  * Relations
- ER diagram (Mermaid)
- Migration strategy

### 7. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/06-development.md - Development Guide

Include:
- Development workflow
- Testing commands (from package.json)
- Code style tools (linter/formatter)
- Pre-commit hooks if detected
- Common tasks with step-by-step instructions:
  * Adding new features
  * Adding API endpoints
  * Adding database tables
  * Running tests

### 8. ~/workspace/.uspark/wiki/07-improvements.md - Tech Debt & Improvements

Include:
- 🔴 Critical Issues (with file:line references)
- 🟡 Technical Debt:
  * Deprecated dependencies
  * Missing tests
  * Code complexity issues
- 🟢 Enhancement Opportunities:
  * Performance improvements
  * Code quality improvements
- 📈 Improvement Roadmap:
  * Quick wins (1-2 days)
  * Medium effort (1 week)
  * Large projects (2+ weeks)

## Quality Standards

**For Every Document:**

1. ✅ **Reference Actual Code**
   - Include file paths with line numbers: \`src/auth/service.ts:45\`
   - Use real class/function names from the code
   - Quote actual code snippets when helpful

2. ✅ **Explain Context**
   - Don't just describe WHAT, explain WHY
   - Note design trade-offs when evident
   - Mention alternatives if discussed in comments

3. ✅ **Be Specific**
   - ❌ Bad: "The app uses a database"
   - ✅ Good: "Uses PostgreSQL 14 with Drizzle ORM (src/db/index.ts:12)"

4. ✅ **Use Diagrams**
   - Use Mermaid for architecture, flows, and ER diagrams
   - Keep diagrams simple and readable

5. ✅ **Keep it Practical**
   - Include runnable command examples
   - Link related files
   - Note common pitfalls found in code/comments

## Important Notes

- All files will auto-sync to uSpark via watch-claude
- Use TodoWrite to show your progress through phases
- READ actual code files - don't guess or assume
- If unsure about something, mark it: "⚠️ Needs verification"
- For sections needing deeper analysis, mark: "🚧 TODO: Deep dive into [topic]"
- Focus on creating practical, actionable documentation

Now begin your comprehensive analysis!`;
