## Notes

**Documentation Quality:**
- Brief commit message compared to some other task updates
- Includes PR reference (PR #107) for traceability
- Mentions key implementation detail (YJS integration)
- Less detailed than some other task completion commits (like b165a48 or 084ce65)

**Technical Context:**
- File explorer component is critical UI component for document browsing
- YJS integration mentioned aligns with overall architecture
- This task likely has corresponding retrospective documentation (see later commits)

**Commit Consistency:**
- Follows established pattern of individual task completion commits
- Part of the series tracking daily development progress
- Could benefit from more implementation detail like other task updates

**Implementation Significance:**
- File explorer is user-facing component crucial for MVP
- YJS integration represents important architectural implementation
- Likely involved complex state management and real-time updates

This commit is functional but could benefit from more detailed implementation highlights like some of the other task completion updates in this series.
