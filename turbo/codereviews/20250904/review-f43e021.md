# Code Review: f43e021 - docs: add mvp specification and update issue documents for mvp scope

## âœ… Overall Assessment: GOOD

Comprehensive MVP specification commit that adds essential project documentation and updates existing specifications to align with MVP scope. Creates clear architectural foundation and user story definitions.

## Key Changes

- Added MVP specification (spec/issues/mvp.md) with 3 core user stories and 5 implementation phases
- Added new specifications: web-ui.md, document-sharing.md 
- Updated existing specs for MVP scope: cli-auth.md, yjs.md, e2b-runtime-container.md
- Simplified authentication to environment variable only (USPARK_TOKEN)
- Added direct Vercel Blob access architecture with STS tokens
- Removed non-MVP features from existing specifications

## Review Criteria

### 1. Mock Analysis
**N/A** - Documentation only.

### 2. Test Coverage
**N/A** - Documentation only.

### 3. Error Handling
**N/A** - Documentation only.

### 4. Interface Changes
**N/A** - Documentation only.

### 5. Timer and Delay Analysis
**N/A** - Documentation only.

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Excellent architectural clarity with STS token approach for Vercel Blob access
- Good MVP discipline - removes complex features to focus on core functionality
- Clear user stories with defined acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- Comprehensive scope definition including what's explicitly out of scope
- Well-structured 5-phase implementation roadmap

**Documentation Quality:**
- Clear and well-organized specification documents
- Good use of acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- Proper architectural decision documentation
- Good balance between detail and clarity

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Direct client access to Vercel Blob using STS tokens eliminates server bottlenecks
- Environment variable authentication simplifies MVP implementation
- YJS-based synchronization provides solid foundation for real-time collaboration

This commit provides essential architectural foundation for the MVP and demonstrates good documentation practices. The simplification approach aligns well with YAGNI principles.
