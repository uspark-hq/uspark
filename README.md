# Makita Stack

A modern, production-ready monorepo template featuring TypeScript, Next.js, and automated CI/CD with comprehensive deployment tracking.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To create a new project from this template, copy and paste the following prompt to your preferred coding AI assistant:

```
I want to create a new project based on the Makita monorepo template. Please help me set up everything automatically.

Here's what I need you to do:
1. First, verify GitHub CLI installation and authentication:
   - Check if `gh` is installed by running `gh --version`
   - If not installed, provide installation instructions:
     - macOS: `brew install gh`
     - Windows: `winget install --id GitHub.cli` or download from https://cli.github.com/
     - Linux: Follow instructions at https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
   - Check authentication status with `gh auth status`
   - If not authenticated, guide through: `gh auth login`
   - Only proceed after confirming successful authentication
2. Ask me for my GitHub username and the new project name
3. Ask me for all the required tokens and secrets (tell me where to get each one)
4. Use GitHub CLI to create a new repository from the makita template
5. Use Vercel API to create web and docs projects automatically
6. Set up all repository secrets and variables using GitHub CLI
7. Replace all "makita" references in the code with my project name
8. If NPM_TOKEN is not provided, remove CLI package and related configurations:
   - Delete turbo/apps/cli directory
   - Remove CLI-related jobs from .github/workflows/turbo.yml and .github/workflows/release-please.yml
   - Remove CLI-related configurations from lefthook.yml and other config files
9. Install dependencies and initialize git repository: `(cd turbo && pnpm install) && (git add . && git commit -m "init commit" && git push)
10. Guide me through any additional setup steps

Required GitHub repository secrets (use `gh secret set`):
- NEON_API_KEY (get from: https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys)
- VERCEL_TOKEN (get from: https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
- DATABASE_URL (production database connection string from Neon)

Optional GitHub repository secrets (only if you want to publish CLI package):
- NPM_TOKEN (get from: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens) - if not provided, CLI package will be removed

Required GitHub repository variables (use `gh variable set`):
- NEON_PROJECT_ID (from your Neon project dashboard)
- VERCEL_TEAM_ID (from Vercel team settings, leave empty for personal account)
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_WEB (will be auto-created via Vercel API)
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DOCS (will be auto-created via Vercel API)

Template repository: https://github.com/e7h4n/makita

Use Vercel API to automatically create:
- Web project: POST https://api.vercel.com/v11/projects with configuration:
  {
    "name": "{project-name}-web",
    "rootDirectory": "turbo/apps/web",
    "buildCommand": "turbo build",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "commandForIgnoringBuildStep": "echo 'Ignored Build Step - builds are handled by GitHub Actions'"
  }
- Docs project: POST https://api.vercel.com/v11/projects with configuration:
  {
    "name": "{project-name}-docs", 
    "rootDirectory": "turbo/apps/docs",
    "buildCommand": "turbo build",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "commandForIgnoringBuildStep": "echo 'Ignored Build Step - builds are handled by GitHub Actions'"
  }
- Get project IDs from responses and set as VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_WEB and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DOCS

Please guide me through this process step by step, asking for one piece of information at a time and explaining what each token is used for.
```

After pasting this prompt, your coding AI will automatically:

- Verify GitHub CLI installation and authentication status
- Create the repository from this template
- Set up Vercel projects for web and docs with proper monorepo configuration
- Configure all required secrets and environment variables
- Replace project names throughout the codebase
- Optionally remove CLI package and related configurations (if NPM_TOKEN not provided)
- Install dependencies (pnpm install) and initialize git repository with commit and push
- Set up the complete CI/CD pipeline

## üõ† Applications

### Web Application (`apps/web`)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Vercel with preview environments
- **Features**: Server-side rendering, API routes, database migrations

### CLI Tool (`apps/cli`)
- **Build**: TSup for fast TypeScript compilation
- **Distribution**: NPM package with binary executable
- **Features**: Commander.js for CLI interface, Chalk for styling

## üèó Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd turbo && pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Type checking
pnpm check-types
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Generate migration files
cd turbo/apps/web && pnpm db:generate

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:studio
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Automated CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Preview Environments**: Automatic PR deployments with isolated database branches
- **Release Management**: Automated releases with release-please
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Ubuntu and macOS E2E testing

### üîÑ Development Workflow

#### Pull Request Workflow
When you create a pull request, the following happens automatically:

1. **üóÉÔ∏è Database Branch Creation**: 
   - A new Neon database branch is created with the name `preview/{branch-name}`
   - Database migrations are applied to the new branch
   - A unique database connection string is generated

2. **üåê Preview Environment Deployment**:
   - Web and docs applications are built and deployed to Vercel preview environments
   - Each deployment gets a unique URL: `{project-name}-web-{branch}.vercel.app`
   - Preview environments use the isolated database branch

3. **üìä Deployment Status**:
   - All deployment statuses are tracked and visible in the PR
   - Links to preview environments and database console are provided
   - GitHub deployment status shows: `web/preview/{branch}`, `docs/preview/{branch}`, `neon/preview/{branch}`

#### Production Release Workflow
Production deployments follow a controlled release process:

1. **üîÄ PR Merge**: When your feature PR is merged to `main`, no automatic production deployment occurs

2. **üìã Release PR Creation**: 
   - `release-please` bot automatically creates or updates a release PR
   - The release PR contains version bumps and changelog updates
   - Multiple feature merges accumulate in a single release PR

3. **üöÄ Production Release**: When the release PR is merged:
   - **Version Update**: Package versions are bumped according to conventional commits
   - **Database Migration**: Production database migrations are applied
   - **Vercel Deployment**: Web and docs apps are deployed to production
   - **NPM Publishing**: CLI package is published to NPM (if configured)
   - **GitHub Release**: A new GitHub release is created with changelog

This workflow ensures:
- ‚úÖ Safe, controlled production deployments
- ‚úÖ Proper version management and changelog generation
- ‚úÖ Database migration safety with preview branches
- ‚úÖ No accidental production deployments from feature branches

### Environment Configuration

#### Repository Secrets
- `NEON_API_KEY`: Neon database API key
- `NPM_TOKEN`: NPM publishing token
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel deployment token
- `DATABASE_URL`: Production database connection string

#### Repository Variables

- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_WEB`: Vercel project ID for web app (auto-created via API)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DOCS`: Vercel project ID for docs (auto-created via API)
- `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`: Vercel team identifier (optional, for team accounts)

### Deployment Targets
- **Web App**: Automatically deployed to Vercel on release
- **CLI Package**: Published to NPM on release (optional, if NPM_TOKEN provided)
- **Documentation**: Deployed to Vercel on release (if configured)

## üß™ Testing
