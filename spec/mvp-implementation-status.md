## Conclusion

**Current State**: uSpark has a **solid foundation** with excellent infrastructure (auth, GitHub, E2B, file storage) and a working chat interface. However, it's **missing critical MVP features** that define its value proposition:

1. **No automated spec generation** - The core differentiator
2. **No markdown preview** - Can't view specs properly
3. **No web editing flow** - Can't manually improve specs

**Recommendation**: Focus next 4-6 weeks on:
1. Markdown preview + edit mode (2 weeks)
2. Spec generation pipeline (2 weeks)
3. Polish and testing (2 weeks)

**MVP Readiness**: Currently **65%** → Can reach **100%** in 6 weeks with focused effort.
