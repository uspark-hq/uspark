# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Specification

## Overview

This document defines the mid-term goals and user stories for the MVP release of Uspark. The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality for GitHub bidirectional synchronization, AI-assisted editing, and document sharing.

## User Stories

### Story 1: GitHub Bidirectional Synchronization (For Human Users)

**As a** developer  
**I want to** sync uSpark documents with GitHub repositories using standard git workflows  
**So that** I can edit with my preferred tools while maintaining version control and team collaboration

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] One-click GitHub OAuth authorization
- [x] Automatic creation of dedicated docs repository (`{workspace}-docs`) ✅
- [ ] Web edits automatically commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Git pushes automatically sync to uSpark (via webhooks)
- [ ] Sync completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Full commit history preserved
- [ ] Standard git commands work (clone, pull, push)
- [ ] No manual conflict resolution needed

#### Technical Requirements

- GitHub API integration for repository management
- Webhook handlers for push events
- Optimistic locking to prevent conflicts
- Support for large documents (>1MB)
- UTF-8 encoding for all markdown files
- Automatic pull before allowing new web edits

### Story 1b: uSpark CLI for E2B Container Synchronization (For AI Agents)

**As an** AI agent running in E2B container  
**I want to** use uspark CLI to sync project files between container and uSpark  
**So that** I can modify files and have changes automatically reflected in the main project

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `uspark pull --project-id <id>` downloads entire project to container
- [x] `uspark push <file-path> --project-id <id>` uploads changes immediately
- [x] `uspark watch-claude` monitors Claude output and syncs file changes
- [x] Authentication via environment variable (USPARK_TOKEN)
- [ ] E2B container pre-configured with uspark CLI ❌

#### Technical Requirements

- YJS-based synchronization protocol
- Vercel Blob storage for file content
- Real-time file change detection via watch-claude
- Container initialization scripts
- Status monitoring through JSON output parsing

### Story 2: Web-based AI Document Editing

**As a** regular user  
**I want to** access my project documents in a web interface and use Claude Code via a chat input  
**So that** I can collaborate with AI to modify documents

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Web dashboard showing list of projects ✅
- [x] Document explorer showing project file tree ✅
- [x] Document viewer/editor for selected files ✅
- [x] Chat interface for entering Claude Code prompts ✅ (UI only)
- [ ] Execution status indicators (via polling) ❌
- [ ] Document updates as Claude makes changes (via YJS polling) ❌

#### Technical Requirements

- E2B container runtime for Claude Code execution
- Polling API for status updates
- YJS for document synchronization (polling-based)
- Queue system for managing Claude tasks
- Audit logging for all AI operations

### Story 3: Document Sharing via Public Links

**As a** regular user  
**I want to** create shareable links for my documents  
**So that** others can view my document content

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] "Share" button on document viewer ✅
- [x] Generate unique, unguessable share links ✅
- [x] View-only access for shared documents ✅
- [x] Share entire project or individual files ✅ (individual files)
- [x] Public preview page with clean UI ✅

#### Technical Requirements

- Secure token generation for share links
- Public routes bypassing authentication
- Read-only document rendering
- Share link management database schema
- Rate limiting for public endpoints

1. All three user stories are fully implemented
2. Core functionality passes QA testing
3. Documentation covers basic usage
4. System handles 10 concurrent users
5. Critical bugs are resolved
6. Deployment pipeline is operational

## Next Steps After MVP

Post-MVP priorities (not in scope for current release):

1. Team collaboration features
2. Advanced AI capabilities
3. Enterprise security features
4. Performance optimizations
5. Mobile applications
6. API for third-party integrations

## Implementation Status Summary (2025-01-12)

### Overall Completion: ~70%

#### ✅ Completed Features (Working)
- **Story 1b (CLI)**: 80% - All CLI commands working, E2B container config missing
- **Story 2 (Web UI)**: 60% - UI complete, Claude execution integration missing  
- **Story 3 (Sharing)**: 100% - Fully implemented with management interface

#### 🟡 Partially Completed
- **Story 1 (GitHub)**: 25% - Repository creation API done, bidirectional sync missing
- **Phase 4 (AI)**: 40% - Session APIs exist, E2B/Claude integration missing

#### ❌ Critical Gaps
1. **GitHub bidirectional sync** - No document push/pull with GitHub
2. **Claude execution in E2B** - Container not configured with Claude CLI
3. **Real-time updates** - Polling hooks need to be re-implemented (closed PRs not satisfactory)
4. **Frontend components** - SessionDisplay, TurnDisplay, BlockDisplay need complete re-implementation

### Key Findings
- **Strong backend infrastructure** with complete APIs and database schema
- **Frontend implementation in closed PRs not satisfactory** - needs complete re-implementation
- **GitHub App foundation ready** but sync logic not implemented
- **E2B integration partial** - watch-claude works but container setup incomplete

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Re-implement frontend components (useSessionPolling, display components)
2. **Week 1**: Implement GitHub document push using Git Trees API
3. **Week 2**: Complete E2B container Claude CLI configuration
4. **Week 3**: Integrate new polling system for real-time updates
