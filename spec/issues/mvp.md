# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Specification

## Overview

This document defines the mid-term goals and user stories for the MVP release of Uspark. The MVP focuses on validating the core technical pipeline: managing AI coding projects through structured documents (tasks, specs, technical debt) that are edited via Claude Code in E2B containers and synced to GitHub for use by external AI coding tools.

## User Stories

### Story 1: GitHub One-Way Synchronization (For Human Users)

**As a** technical CEO/founder or developer
**I want to** push uSpark documents to my existing GitHub repository's `/spec` directory
**So that** AI coding tools can access project context and specs alongside my codebase

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] One-click GitHub App installation ‚úÖ
- [ ] ‚ùå Select existing repository from user's repos (currently creates dedicated repo)
- [ ] ‚ùå Sync to `/spec` directory in existing repo (currently mirrors entire project to new repo)
- [x] Web edits can be manually synced to GitHub via sync button ‚úÖ
- [x] Sync completes within 5 seconds ‚úÖ
- [x] Full file content pushed to GitHub ‚úÖ
- [x] Settings UI for GitHub connection management ‚úÖ
- [x] Sync status indicator showing last sync time ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic sync lock to prevent concurrent operations ‚úÖ
- [ ] ‚ùå Preserve existing files outside `/spec` directory (currently replaces entire repo)

#### Technical Requirements

- GitHub App integration (not OAuth) for better security
- Git Trees API for efficient file uploads
- Installation token management
- Support for large documents (>1MB)
- UTF-8 encoding for all markdown files
- In-memory sync lock to prevent race conditions

#### Out of Scope for MVP

- GitHub ‚Üí Web synchronization (future enhancement)
- Automatic sync on every edit (manual sync only)
- Conflict resolution (one-way sync avoids conflicts)
- Branch management (main branch only)
- Pull operations from GitHub

### Story 1b: uSpark CLI for E2B Container Synchronization (For AI Agents)

**As** Claude Code running in E2B container
**I want to** use uspark CLI to sync project files between container and uSpark
**So that** I can analyze and modify project management documents based on user prompts

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `uspark pull --project-id <id>` downloads entire project to container ‚úÖ
- [x] `uspark push <file-path> --project-id <id>` uploads changes immediately ‚úÖ
- [x] `uspark watch-claude` monitors Claude output and syncs file changes ‚úÖ
- [x] Authentication via environment variable (USPARK_TOKEN) ‚úÖ
- [x] E2B container pre-configured with Claude Code CLI ‚úÖ (Basic Dockerfile)
- [ ] E2B container pre-configured with uspark CLI ‚ùå (Still needs installation)

#### Technical Requirements

- YJS-based synchronization protocol
- Vercel Blob storage for file content
- Real-time file change detection via watch-claude
- Container initialization scripts
- Status monitoring through JSON output parsing

### Story 2: Web-based AI Document Editing

**As a** technical founder/developer
**I want to** access my project documents in a web interface and use Claude Code via a chat input
**So that** I can generate tasks, technical specs, and manage my AI coding workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Web dashboard showing list of projects ‚úÖ
- [x] Document explorer showing project file tree ‚úÖ
- [x] Document viewer/editor for selected files ‚úÖ
- [x] Chat interface for entering Claude Code prompts ‚úÖ (UI only)
- [x] Execution status indicators (via polling) ‚úÖ (PR #320)
- [x] Document updates as Claude makes changes (via YJS polling) ‚úÖ (PR #320)

#### Technical Requirements

- E2B container runtime for Claude Code execution
- Polling API for status updates
- YJS for document synchronization (polling-based)
- Queue system for managing Claude tasks
- Audit logging for all AI operations
