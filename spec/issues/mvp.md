# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Specification

## Overview

This document defines the mid-term goals and user stories for the MVP release of Uspark. The MVP focuses on validating the core technical pipeline: managing AI coding projects through structured documents (tasks, specs, technical debt) that are edited via Claude Code in E2B containers and synced to GitHub for use by external AI coding tools.

## User Stories

### Story 1: GitHub One-Way Synchronization (For Human Users)

**As a** technical CEO/founder or developer
**I want to** push uSpark documents to GitHub repositories
**So that** AI coding tools can access project context and specs from the repository

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] One-click GitHub App installation ‚úÖ
- [x] Automatic creation of dedicated repository (`uspark-{project.id}`) ‚úÖ
- [x] Web edits can be manually synced to GitHub via sync button ‚úÖ
- [x] Sync completes within 5 seconds ‚úÖ
- [x] Full file content pushed to GitHub ‚úÖ
- [x] Settings UI for GitHub connection management ‚úÖ
- [x] Sync status indicator showing last sync time ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic sync lock to prevent concurrent operations ‚úÖ

#### Technical Requirements

- GitHub App integration (not OAuth) for better security
- Git Trees API for efficient file uploads
- Installation token management
- Support for large documents (>1MB)
- UTF-8 encoding for all markdown files
- In-memory sync lock to prevent race conditions

#### Out of Scope for MVP

- GitHub ‚Üí Web synchronization (future enhancement)
- Automatic sync on every edit (manual sync only)
- Conflict resolution (one-way sync avoids conflicts)
- Branch management (main branch only)
- Pull operations from GitHub

### Story 1b: uSpark CLI for E2B Container Synchronization (For AI Agents)

**As** Claude Code running in E2B container
**I want to** use uspark CLI to sync project files between container and uSpark
**So that** I can analyze and modify project management documents based on user prompts

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `uspark pull --project-id <id>` downloads entire project to container ‚úÖ
- [x] `uspark push <file-path> --project-id <id>` uploads changes immediately ‚úÖ
- [x] `uspark watch-claude` monitors Claude output and syncs file changes ‚úÖ
- [x] Authentication via environment variable (USPARK_TOKEN) ‚úÖ
- [x] E2B container pre-configured with Claude Code CLI ‚úÖ (Basic Dockerfile)
- [ ] E2B container pre-configured with uspark CLI ‚ùå (Still needs installation)

#### Technical Requirements

- YJS-based synchronization protocol
- Vercel Blob storage for file content
- Real-time file change detection via watch-claude
- Container initialization scripts
- Status monitoring through JSON output parsing

### Story 2: Web-based AI Document Editing

**As a** technical founder/developer
**I want to** access my project documents in a web interface and use Claude Code via a chat input
**So that** I can generate tasks, technical specs, and manage my AI coding workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Web dashboard showing list of projects ‚úÖ
- [x] Document explorer showing project file tree ‚úÖ
- [x] Document viewer/editor for selected files ‚úÖ
- [x] Chat interface for entering Claude Code prompts ‚úÖ (UI only)

- [ ] Document updates as Claude makes changes (via YJS polling) ‚ùå

#### Technical Requirements

- E2B container runtime for Claude Code execution
- Polling API for status updates
- YJS for document synchronization (polling-based)
- Queue system for managing Claude tasks
- Audit logging for all AI operations

### Story 3: Task Generation and AI Control (NEW MVP FOCUS)

**As a** technical founder using AI coding tools
**I want to** generate structured tasks with prompts that control Claude Code
**So that** I can orchestrate my AI coding workflow efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Predefined prompt templates for common tasks (e.g., "Analyze codebase", "Generate task breakdown")
- [ ] One-click prompt insertion into chat interface
- [ ] Task documents automatically created from AI responses
- [ ] Generated prompts optimized for Claude Code execution
- [ ] Progress tracking as tasks are completed

#### Technical Requirements

- Prompt template system with variable substitution
- Task document generation from Claude responses
- Integration between task documents and Claude execution
- Status tracking for task completion

1. All three user stories are fully implemented
2. Core functionality passes QA testing
3. Documentation covers basic usage
4. System handles 10 concurrent users
5. Critical bugs are resolved
6. Deployment pipeline is operational

## Implementation Status Summary (2025-01-13)

### Overall Completion: ~65%

#### ‚úÖ Completed Features (Working)
- **Story 1 (GitHub)**: 100% - All MVP requirements completed ‚úÖ
- **Story 1b (CLI)**: 85% - All CLI commands working, E2B container partially configured
- **Story 3 (Task Generation)**: 0% - New focus, not yet implemented

#### üü° Partially Completed
- **Story 2 (Web UI)**: 65% - UI complete, Claude sessions schema done, APIs missing
- **Phase 4 (AI)**: 40% - Session APIs exist, E2B/Claude integration missing

#### ‚ùå Critical Gaps
1. **Claude execution in E2B** - Container has Claude CLI but missing uspark CLI
2. **Real-time updates** - Polling hooks need to be re-implemented
3. **Session/Turn/Block APIs** - Schema exists but API endpoints not implemented

### Key Findings
- **Strong backend infrastructure** with complete APIs and database schema
- **Frontend implementation in closed PRs not satisfactory** - needs complete re-implementation
- **GitHub sync fully implemented** with Git Trees API for efficient sync ‚úÖ
- **E2B integration partial** - watch-claude works but container setup incomplete

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Complete E2B container setup with uspark CLI
2. **Week 1**: Implement prompt template system
3. **Week 2**: Build task ‚Üí Claude Code execution pipeline
4. **Week 3**: Test end-to-end workflow with real projects
