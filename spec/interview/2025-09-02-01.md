## Interview Transcript

### Opening Question
Here's the link to the 3 most important user stories I wrote for uspark: https://github.com/uspark-hq/uspark/tree/main/spec. Would you have time to take a look?

### Follow-up Comments

**User A:** Have you considered targeting professional knowledge workers like media professionals and journalists?

For example, the podcast media company "Shengdong Huopo" (声动活泼) - many of their content producers seem to work with markdown-based workflows. From what I understand, several of their producers use tools like Bear or Obsidian.

### Feedback on Product Manager User Story
**Link:** https://github.com/uspark-hq/uspark/blob/main/spec/user_story_product_manager.md

**User A:** I reviewed the product manager user story, and it looks pretty good. Let me share some pain points I've experienced when writing PRDs with AI:

Can you open this link? Previously when I was writing the Motiff points deduction rules, the process was roughly: have an initial conversation with the AI, identify valuable ideas from the discussion, directly copy them over, then make simple modifications. The challenge here is that conveying context to the AI is quite cumbersome.

### Feedback on Team Collaboration User Story
**Link:** https://github.com/uspark-hq/uspark/blob/main/spec/user_story_team_collaboration.md

**User A:** Regarding the collaboration scenario, after thinking about my own work situations, it seems the main need is for weekly meetings and information synchronization meetings where multiple people edit the same document.

In other scenarios, it tends to be more about one person completing a document and then sharing it - the collaboration aspect isn't that strong.

### Additional Pain Point: Multi-device Usage

**User A:** There's another pain point I'm experiencing with using multiple devices. For instance, I have an iMac and a portable MacBook Pro. Tools like Cursor and CC store chat history locally only. Once I switch computers, my conversation history and context are gone, making it very inconvenient to switch between devices. (Any users with multiple devices might have this problem.)

## Analysis and Summary

### Key Insights

#### 1. Target Audience Expansion
- **Opportunity:** Professional knowledge workers in media/journalism sector
- **Example:** Podcast production companies already using markdown-based workflows
- **Tools in use:** Bear, Obsidian (indicating markdown familiarity)

#### 2. Product Manager Workflow Pain Points
- **Context Transfer Challenge:** Difficulty in maintaining and transferring context when working with AI assistants
- **Current Workaround:** Manual copy-paste workflow with modifications
- **Need:** Seamless context preservation and transfer between AI interactions and document creation

#### 3. Collaboration Patterns
- **High-value Use Case:** Weekly meetings and information sync meetings requiring real-time multi-user editing
- **Reality Check:** Most document work is single-author with subsequent sharing
- **Implication:** Collaboration features might be over-emphasized; focus should be on specific high-value scenarios

#### 4. Cross-Device Synchronization
- **Critical Pain Point:** Loss of chat history and context when switching devices
- **Affected Users:** Anyone with multiple workstations (desktop + laptop common setup)
- **Technical Issue:** Local-only storage of conversation history in current tools (Cursor, CC)
- **Business Impact:** Workflow disruption and productivity loss

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Cross-Device Sync:** This appears to be a fundamental issue affecting productivity for multi-device users
2. **Refine Collaboration Focus:** Rather than broad collaboration features, focus on specific scenarios like meeting notes
3. **Improve Context Management:** Develop better ways to maintain and transfer context in AI-assisted workflows
4. **Consider Media/Journalism Vertical:** This sector shows existing markdown adoption and could be an early adopter segment

### Questions for Follow-up
1. How frequently does User A switch between devices in a typical work week?
2. What specific features in Bear/Obsidian are most valuable for the media professionals mentioned?
3. Can User A provide more details about the Motiff PRD workflow and where it breaks down?
4. What percentage of documents require real-time collaboration vs. asynchronous review?
