# User Story: Team Real-time Collaboration

## Overview

As a team member, I want to collaborate with colleagues on AI-generated documents in real-time, so that we can build shared knowledge efficiently and maintain alignment across the team.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Cross-functional team member (Designer, Developer, PM, etc.)
- **Team Size**: 3-10 people working on the same project
- **Pain Points**:
  - Knowledge silos between team members
  - Difficulty tracking document changes
  - Lost context when switching between chat and documents

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Real-time Collaboration**

   - See other users' cursors and selections
   - Changes appear instantly for all viewers
   - No conflicts or data loss during simultaneous editing

2. **Collaborative AI Interaction**

   - Any team member can continue AI conversation
   - AI understands full document context and history
   - Team can collectively refine documents through AI

3. **Change Visibility**

   - Clear indication of who made what changes
   - Activity feed showing recent modifications
   - Presence indicators for active collaborators

4. **Knowledge Persistence**
   - All team interactions preserved
   - Documents become team knowledge base
   - Searchable across team workspace

## Example Workflow

1. PM creates initial product spec through AI conversation
2. Designer joins and adds UI/UX considerations via chat
3. Developer sees changes in real-time, adds technical constraints
4. Team discusses implementation in comments
5. AI helps refine based on collective input
6. Final document reflects team consensus

## Success Metrics

- Increased document contribution from all team members
- Faster decision-making through shared context
- Knowledge retention improved across projects
