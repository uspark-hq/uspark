# User Story: Small Team Coordinating AI Development

## Overview

As a technical team lead, I want to coordinate multiple developers using different AI coding tools, so that we build a coherent product architecture despite everyone working with AI assistance at different speeds and styles.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Technical Team Lead / Senior Developer
- **Team Size**: 2-5 developers, all using AI tools
- **Pain Points**:
  - Each developer's AI generates different patterns
  - Duplicate implementations of similar features
  - Architecture drift from original design
  - No visibility into what AI is building where
  - Technical debt multiplies across team

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Unified Task Distribution**

   - Central task board with AI-ready prompts
   - Each task has assigned owner and context
   - No two developers working on overlapping code
   - Clear dependencies between tasks

2. **Architecture Consistency**

   - Shared architecture decisions in `/specs/architecture`
   - AI prompts include architectural constraints
   - Pattern library for common implementations
   - Automatic detection of architecture violations

3. **Progress Visibility**

   - Real-time view of what each developer is building
   - Commit analysis shows actual vs planned progress
   - Daily summary of changes across all repos
   - Technical debt dashboard for entire team

4. **Knowledge Sharing**

   - Failed attempts documented for team learning
   - Successful patterns become team templates
   - Code review prep with architectural analysis
   - Cross-pollination of good solutions

## Example Workflow

1. Lead describes feature: "We need user authentication with JWT"
2. uSpark analyzes codebase and creates implementation plan
3. Breaks into 3 parallel tasks:
   - Backend: JWT token generation and validation
   - Frontend: Login/logout UI components
   - Database: User schema and session management
4. Each developer gets personalized prompt with their context
5. As commits come in, uSpark tracks progress:
   - Backend dev finished early, helps with session management
   - Frontend dev's AI used different state management, needs alignment
   - Database implementation has security issue, flagged for review
6. Daily standup automated: uSpark presents what was actually built
7. Technical debt from all three parts consolidated and prioritized

## Technical Requirements

- Multi-repository support (backend, frontend, mobile)
- Cross-repository dependency tracking
- Unified commit analysis across team
- Integration with GitHub pull requests
- Support for different AI tool outputs

## Success Metrics

- Architecture consistency score: > 80%
- Duplicate work eliminated: 0 overlapping implementations
- Time to identify issues: Within same day
- Technical debt per sprint: < 20% of new code
- Team velocity: 2x compared to solo AI coding
