# User Story: Developer Local File Sync

## Overview

As a developer, I want to sync uSpark documents to my local filesystem and edit them with my preferred tools, so that I can maintain my existing workflow while benefiting from AI-powered document generation.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Software Developer / Technical Writer
- **Tools**: VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, or other preferred editors
- **Pain Points**:
  - Context switching between web editor and local IDE
  - Unable to use familiar keyboard shortcuts and extensions
  - Difficulty integrating AI content into existing projects

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Local Sync Setup**

   - Simple installation via command-line tool (`usync`)
   - macOS: Native Finder integration via File Provider
   - Cross-platform CLI support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
   - One-time authentication setup

2. **Bidirectional Sync**

   - Changes in cloud immediately reflected locally
   - Local edits automatically synced back to cloud
   - Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
   - Offline editing with sync on reconnection

3. **File System Integration**

   - Documents appear as regular Markdown files
   - Maintain folder structure from workspace

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Use any text editor or IDE
   - Batch operations support (grep, find, sed)

## Example Workflow

1. Developer installs `usync` CLI tool
2. Authenticates and selects workspace to sync
3. Documents appear in `usync` target folder
4. Opens PRD.md in VS Code, makes edits
5. Changes auto-sync to cloud, visible to team
6. Can continue AI conversation based on local edits
7. Commits important docs to project Git repo

## Technical Requirements

- File system events monitoring
- Incremental sync (only changed portions)
- Maximum 2-second sync latency
- Support for large documents (>1MB)

## Success Metrics

- 90% of developers adopt local sync within first week
- Zero data loss during sync operations
- Sync latency under 2 seconds for 95% of operations
- Seamless integration with existing dev workflows
