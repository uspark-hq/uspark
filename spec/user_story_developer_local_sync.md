# User Story: Developer GitHub Sync

## Overview

As a developer, I want to sync uSpark documents with GitHub repositories using standard git workflows, so that I can edit with my preferred tools while maintaining version control and team collaboration.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Software Developer / Technical Writer
- **Tools**: VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, or other preferred editors
- **Pain Points**:
  - Context switching between web editor and local IDE
  - Unable to use familiar keyboard shortcuts and extensions
  - Lack of version control for AI-generated content
  - Difficulty integrating AI content into existing projects

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **GitHub Integration Setup**

   - One-click GitHub OAuth authorization
   - Automatic creation of dedicated docs repository (`{workspace}-docs`)
   - No additional tools or CLI installation required
   - Works with existing git installation

2. **Bidirectional Sync**

   - Web edits automatically commit and push to GitHub
   - Git pushes automatically sync to uSpark (via webhooks)
   - Sync completes within 5 seconds
   - Full commit history preserved

3. **Conflict Prevention**

   - Web editor shows "Syncing..." when GitHub has newer commits
   - Automatic pull before allowing new web edits
   - Clear indication of sync status in UI
   - No manual conflict resolution needed

4. **Developer Experience**

   - Standard git commands (clone, pull, push)
   - Use any text editor or IDE
   - Full offline editing support
   - Batch operations support (grep, find, sed)
   - Branch protection for main branch (optional)

## Example Workflow

1. Developer connects GitHub account to uSpark
2. uSpark creates `my-project-docs` repository
3. Developer clones repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/user/my-project-docs
   cd my-project-docs
   ```
4. Opens PRD.md in VS Code, makes edits
5. Commits and pushes changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "refine user requirements"
   git push
   ```
6. Changes appear in uSpark web UI within seconds
7. Team can continue AI conversation based on updates
8. All changes tracked in git history

## Technical Requirements

- GitHub API integration for repository management
- Webhook handlers for push events
- Optimistic locking to prevent conflicts
- Support for large documents (>1MB)
- UTF-8 encoding for all markdown files

## Success Metrics

- 90% of developers adopt GitHub sync within first week
- Zero data loss during sync operations
- Sync latency under 5 seconds for 95% of operations
- Zero merge conflicts in normal usage
- 100% compatibility with existing git tools
