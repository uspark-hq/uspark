# User Story: Solo Developer Managing AI Coding Projects

## Overview

As a solo developer using AI coding tools, I want uSpark to push project specs and documentation to my GitHub repository's `/specs` folder, so that all my AI tools can access consistent project context and I can track the evolution of my project's architecture.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Solo Developer / Indie Hacker
- **Tools**: Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
- **Pain Points**:
  - Each AI session starts from scratch, no project memory
  - Context lost between different AI tools
  - Hard to track what was planned vs what was built
  - Technical debt accumulates without visibility
  - Switching between projects loses all context

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **GitHub Repository Integration**

   - Connect existing project repository (not a separate docs repo)
   - uSpark pushes to `/specs` folder in the main repo
   - Specs become part of project's version history
   - Available to all AI tools that can read the repo

2. **Automatic Spec Generation**

   - Task breakdowns saved as `tasks/feature-name.md`
   - Architecture decisions saved as `architecture/decisions/ADR-xxx.md`
   - Progress reports saved as `progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Technical debt tracked in `debt/registry.md`

3. **Context Preservation**

   - Each AI coding session starts with full project context
   - Can ask "What was I working on?" and get accurate answer
   - Previous attempts and failures documented
   - Learn from what didn't work

4. **Multi-Project Management**

   - Switch between projects without losing context
   - Each project maintains its own spec history
   - Cross-project learnings can be applied
   - Dashboard view of all active projects

## Example Workflow

1. Developer describes new feature: "Add real-time notifications"
2. uSpark analyzes existing codebase, creates plan
3. Pushes to repo:
   ```
   /specs/tasks/real-time-notifications.md
   /specs/architecture/decisions/ADR-004-websocket-vs-sse.md
   ```
4. Developer opens Cursor, AI reads specs from repo
5. Implements feature following the plan
6. Commits code, uSpark analyzes changes
7. Updates progress and identifies new debt:
   ```
   /specs/progress/2024-01-15.md
   /specs/debt/registry.md (updated)
   ```
8. Next AI session has full context of what was built

## Technical Requirements

- GitHub API for repository access and commits
- Markdown formatting for all specs
- Incremental updates (don't regenerate everything)
- Respect .gitignore patterns
- Support for monorepos and multiple projects

## Success Metrics

- Context retention across sessions: 100%
- Time to resume work after break: < 2 minutes
- Technical debt visibility: All issues tracked
- Project abandonment rate: < 20%
- Cross-tool compatibility: Works with all major AI coding tools
