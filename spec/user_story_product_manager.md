# User Story: Product Manager Creating PRD Documents

## Overview

As a Product Manager, I want to generate structured PRD (Product Requirements Document) through natural language conversation with AI, so that I can quickly create professional documentation that can be saved, edited, and reused.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Product Manager
- **Experience**: Familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT/Claude
- **Pain Points**:
  - Time-consuming manual PRD writing
  - Difficulty maintaining document consistency
  - Lost conversation context in traditional AI tools

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Natural Conversation Input**

   - Describe product requirements in plain language
   - AI understands context and asks clarifying questions
   - No need to learn complex formatting or tools

2. **Automatic Document Generation**

   - AI generates well-structured Markdown PRD
   - Includes standard sections (overview, user stories, requirements, etc.)
   - Maintains professional formatting and organization

3. **Document Management**

   - Documents automatically saved to workspace
   - Can access and edit generated documents anytime
   - Version history tracking for iterations

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Continue conversation to refine specific sections
   - AI remembers document context for improvements
   - Changes reflected in saved document immediately

## Example Workflow

1. PM describes: "I need a PRD for a user authentication feature with SSO support"
2. AI generates initial PRD with standard sections
3. PM reviews and requests: "Add more detail about the security requirements"
4. AI updates the document with enhanced security section
5. PM can edit directly or continue conversing for further refinements

## Success Metrics

- Time to create PRD reduced by 70%
- Document quality consistency improved
- Reusability of document templates increased
