# User Story: Technical CEO Building Complex Applications

## Overview

As a Technical CEO/Founder, I want to transform my product vision directly into structured technical tasks and architectures through AI conversation, so that I can build sophisticated applications using AI coding tools without getting lost in complexity or accumulating unmanageable technical debt.

## User Profile

- **Role**: Technical CEO/Founder
- **Experience**: Can code with AI tools (Cursor/Claude Code) but lacks deep software engineering expertise
- **Pain Points**:
  - AI tools can write code but can't manage project complexity
  - Losing context between AI coding sessions
  - Technical debt accumulates faster than understanding grows
  - Hard to break down ambitious features into AI-manageable chunks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vision to Architecture Translation**

   - Describe product vision in business terms
   - uSpark analyzes GitHub repo and suggests technical approach
   - Breaks down into implementable components with clear boundaries

2. **AI-Ready Task Generation**

   - Automatically generates prompts optimized for Claude Code/Cursor
   - Each prompt includes full context, constraints, and success criteria
   - Tasks sized appropriately for AI capabilities (not too complex)

3. **Reality-Based Progress Tracking**

   - Analyzes actual commits to verify what was built
   - Compares implementation against original plan
   - Identifies gaps and suggests corrections

4. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Proactively identifies code quality issues from commits
   - Prioritizes debt that blocks future features
   - Generates refactoring tasks when debt becomes critical

## Example Workflow

1. CEO describes: "I need a real-time collaboration tool like Figma but for API documentation"
2. uSpark analyzes similar products and suggests architecture:
   - WebSocket service for real-time sync
   - CRDT for conflict resolution
   - PostgreSQL for persistence
3. Breaks down into 15 atomic tasks with specific prompts
4. CEO copies prompts to Claude Code, implements features
5. uSpark analyzes commits, identifies that WebSocket implementation has issues
6. Generates debugging and refactoring tasks to fix problems
7. CEO continues building with confidence that foundation is solid

## Success Metrics

- Time from idea to working MVP: 3-5 days
- Technical debt kept below 30% threshold
- Features successfully implemented without major rework: 80%
- Project abandonment rate: < 20% (vs 60% for ad-hoc AI coding)
