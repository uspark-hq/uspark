# Private Repository Content Sharing

## Scenario

**Given:** User manages documents using git + Claude Code with AI collaboration

**When:** User wants to share a text file from their GitHub repository with other users

**Then:** Unable to share because the repository is private

## Expected Behavior

**Expect:** For private note repositories, should be able to configure independent access permissions for individual pages to enable sharing or publishing

## Impact

- Users cannot selectively share specific documents from their private knowledge base
- Forced to either make entire repository public or manually copy content elsewhere
- Breaks the workflow of maintaining a single source of truth for documentation

## Potential Solutions

- Implement page-level access control mechanism
- Generate shareable links with temporary or permanent access tokens
- Create a publishing feature that allows selective content exposure
- Support integration with external sharing platforms while maintaining source in private repo
